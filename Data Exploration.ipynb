       " 'blood pressure is measurement of the pressure in your arteries during the active and resting phases of each heartbeat here what the numbers mean systolic pressure the first top number in blood pressure reading this is the amount of pressure your heart generates when pumping blood through your arteries to the rest of your body diastolic pressure the second bottom number in blood pressure reading this refers to the amount of pressure in your arteries when your heart is at rest between beats current guidelines identify normal blood pressure as lower than     mm hg although you can get an accurate blood pressure reading at any given time blood pressure isn always the same it can vary considerably in short amount of time sometimes from one heartbeat to the next depending on body position breathing rhythm stress level physical condition medications you take what you eat and drink and even time of day blood pressure is usually lowest at night and rises sharply on waking blood pressure how low can you go what considered low blood pressure for you may be normal for someone else most doctors consider chronically low blood pressure too low only if it causes noticeable symptoms some experts define low blood pressure as readings lower than   mm hg systolic or   mm hg diastolic you need to have only one number in the low range for your blood pressure to be considered lower than normal in other words if your systolic pressure is perfect   but your diastolic pressure is   you re considered to have lower than normal pressure sudden fall in blood pressure also can be dangerous change of just   mm hg drop from   systolic to   mm hg systolic for example can cause dizziness and fainting when the brain fails to receive an adequate supply of blood and big plunges especially those caused by uncontrolled bleeding severe infections or allergic reactions can be life threatening athletes and people who exercise regularly tend to have lower blood pressure and slower heart rate than do people who aren as fit so in general do nonsmokers and people who eat healthy diet and maintain normal weight but in some rare instances low blood pressure can be sign of serious even life threatening disorders conditions that can cause low blood pressure some medical conditions can cause low blood pressure these include pregnancy because woman circulatory system expands rapidly during pregnancy blood pressure is likely to drop this is normal and blood pressure usually returns to your pre pregnancy level after you ve given birth heart problems some heart conditions that can lead to low blood pressure include extremely low heart rate bradycardia heart valve problems heart attack and heart failure these conditions may cause low blood pressure because they prevent your body from being able to circulate enough blood endocrine problems thyroid conditions such as parathyroid disease adrenal insufficiency addison disease low blood sugar hypoglycemia and in some cases diabetes can trigger low blood pressure dehydration when you become dehydrated your body loses more water than it takes in even mild dehydration can cause weakness dizziness and fatigue fever vomiting severe diarrhea overuse of diuretics and strenuous exercise can all lead to dehydration far more serious is hypovolemic shock life threatening complication of dehydration it occurs when low blood volume causes sudden drop in blood pressure and reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching your tissues if untreated severe hypovolemic shock can cause death within few minutes or hours blood loss losing lot of blood from major injury or internal bleeding reduces the amount of blood in your body leading to severe drop in blood pressure severe infection septicemia septicemia can happen when an infection in the body enters the bloodstream this condition can lead to life threatening drop in blood pressure called septic shock severe allergic reaction anaphylaxis anaphylaxis is severe and potentially life threatening allergic reaction common triggers of anaphylaxis include foods certain medications insect venoms and latex anaphylaxis can cause breathing problems hives itching swollen throat and drop in blood pressure lack of nutrients in your diet lack of the vitamins   and folate can cause condition in which your body doesn produce enough red blood cells anemia causing low blood pressure medications that can cause low blood pressure some medications you may take can also cause low blood pressure including diuretics water pills such as furosemide lasix and hydrochlorothiazide microzide oretic alpha blockers such as prazosin minipress and labetalol beta blockers such as atenolol tenormin propranolol inderal innopran xl others and timolol drugs for parkinson disease such as pramipexole mirapex or those containing levodopa certain types of antidepressants tricyclic antidepressants including doxepin silenor imipramine tofranil protriptyline vivactil and trimipramine surmontil sildenafil viagra or tadalafil cialis particularly in combination with the heart medication nitroglycerin types of low blood pressure doctors often break down low blood pressure hypotension into different categories depending on the causes and other factors some types of low blood pressure include low blood pressure on standing up orthostatic or postural hypotension this is sudden drop in blood pressure when you stand up from sitting position or if you stand up after lying down ordinarily gravity causes blood to pool in your legs whenever you stand your body compensates for this by increasing your heart rate and constricting blood vessels thereby ensuring that enough blood returns to your brain but in people with orthostatic hypotension this compensating mechanism fails and blood pressure falls leading to symptoms of dizziness lightheadedness blurred vision and even fainting orthostatic hypotension can occur for variety of reasons including dehydration prolonged bed rest pregnancy diabetes heart problems burns excessive heat large varicose veins and certain neurological disorders number of medications also can cause orthostatic hypotension particularly drugs used to treat high blood pressure diuretics beta blockers calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors as well as antidepressants and drugs used to treat parkinson disease and erectile dysfunction orthostatic hypotension is especially common in older adults with as many as   percent of those older than age   experiencing orthostatic hypotension but orthostatic hypotension can also affect young otherwise healthy people who stand up suddenly after sitting with their legs crossed for long periods or after working for time in squatting position low blood pressure after eating postprandial hypotension postprandial hypotension is sudden drop in blood pressure after eating it affects mostly older adults just as gravity pulls blood to your feet when you stand large amount of blood flows to your digestive tract after you eat ordinarily your body counteracts this by increasing your heart rate and constricting certain blood vessels to help maintain normal blood pressure but in some people these mechanisms fail leading to dizziness faintness and falls postprandial hypotension is more likely to affect people with high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system disorders such as parkinson disease lowering the dose of blood pressure drugs and eating small low carbohydrate meals may help reduce symptoms low blood pressure from faulty brain signals neurally mediated hypotension this disorder causes blood pressure to drop after standing for long periods leading to signs and symptoms such as dizziness nausea and fainting neurally mediated hypotension mostly affects young people and it seems to occur because of miscommunication between the heart and the brain when you stand for extended periods your blood pressure falls as blood pools in your legs normally your body then makes adjustments to normalize your blood pressure but in people with neurally mediated hypotension nerves in the heart left ventricle actually signal the brain that blood pressure is too high rather than too low as result the brain lessens the heart rate decreasing blood pressure even further this causes more blood to pool in the legs and less blood to reach the brain leading to lightheadedness and fainting low blood pressure due to nervous system damage multiple system atrophy with orthostatic hypotension also called shy drager syndrome this rare disorder causes progressive damage to the autonomic nervous system which controls involuntary functions such as blood pressure heart rate breathing and digestion although this condition can be associated with muscle tremors slowed movement problems with coordination and speech and incontinence its main characteristic is severe orthostatic hypotension in combination with very high blood pressure when lying down low blood pressure causes general hypotension low blood pressure without symptoms is not generally cause for concern long term hypotension that does not cause symptoms is rarely serious in fact many athletes have low blood pressure and have decreased risk of developing heart disease hypotension that causes symptoms may be sign of an underlying health condition sometimes hypotension may even indicate serious and or life threatening problem such as widespread infection below are some of the most common causes of hypotension allergic reaction anaphylaxis life threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis often causes sudden and dramatic drop in blood pressure additional symptoms may include itching hives difficulty breathing swelling of the throat and tongue stomach cramps nausea and diarrhea this reaction may occur in response to medications herbs supplements foods such as peanuts bee stings or other severe allergies blood loss sudden hypotension may occur if person loses lot of blood from serious injury internal bleeding or complications during surgery the severity of hypotension depends on how much blood is lost endocrine problems endocrine disorders also called hormonal disorders may cause hypotension endocrine problems occur when the body releases too many or too few hormones which are chemicals that help regulate bodily functions endocrine problems such as an underactive thyroid called hypothyroidism overactive thyroid called hyperthyroidism adrenal insufficiency called addison disease low blood sugar levels and in some cases diabetes may lead to hypotension dehydration dehydration may lead to hypotension even mild dehydration may cause symptoms such as lightheadedness dizziness and weakness severe dehydration may lead to life threatening complication called hypovolemic shock this condition occurs when decreased blood volume in the body causes sudden drop in blood pressure as result the body tissues and organs do not receive enough oxygen if left untreated hypoyolemic shock may be fatal within few minutes to hours heart problems several heart problems including an extremely low heart rate called bradycardia heart valve problems heart attack and heart failure may lead to hypotension these conditions prevent the body from circulating enough blood to tissues and organs medications many drugs can cause low blood pressure including diuretics blood pressure lowering drugs heart medications such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers drugs used to treat parkinson disease tricyclic antidepressants erectile dysfunction drugs such as viagra narcotics and alcohol other medications prescription and over the counter may lower blood pressure when they are taken in combination with blood pressure lowering drugs nutritional deficiencies people who have low levels of vitamin   and folate may develop anemia condition that may cause low blood pressure people who have eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia have an increased risk of developing nutritional deficiencies that can lead to hypotension pregnancy woman blood pressure often decreases during pregnancy this is because the mother circulatory system expands quickly during pregnancy during the first   weeks of pregnancy it is common for woman systolic blood pressure to drop five to   points and for her diastolic pressure to drop     points septicemia and septic shock severe infection called septicemia may lead to hypotension septicemia occurs when an infection enters the bloodstream and spreads throughout the body as the heart works extra hard to pump blood throughout the body it starts to weaken and blood pressure drops when blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels the condition is called septic shock ',\n",

series of setbacks which have sent shares in the swiss pharmaceuticals group down more than quarter in the past year disappointing sales of new heart drug have combined with problems in the group alcon eyecare business to create arguably the rockiest period for mr jimenez since the american took charge six years ago legal risks have added to the gloom as novartis faces investigation for suspected marketing abuses in the us south korea and turkey on top of recent cases in japan and china all these problems have been brewing for months but the heat has turned up in the past few weeks as succession of analysts cut growth forecasts for the group mr jimenez still has credit with investors for asweeping overhaul in which novartis has narrowed the sprawling range of businesses built by his predecessor daniel vasella he is likely to trumpet progress towards cutting costs and restructuring alcon when the group announces first quarter results on thursday however the headline numbers are unlikely to part the clouds hanging over novartis analysts expect sales and profits to be down as the eyecare business continues to drag on performance the mood was much different year ago when the group was preparing to launch entresto much anticipated treatment for heart failure data showing that the drug cut deaths by fifth in clinical trials fuelled confidence that it would be the new blockbuster novartis desperately needed to offset the looming loss of patent protection on its best selling gleevec cancer drug yet instead of the expected gush sales of entresto started at trickle the  m registered in the final quarter of   was less than tenth of analysts forecast they have described the launch as glacial and huge disappointment novartis declined to comment citing the quiet period ahead of its results but analysts sympathetic to the group point out that mr jimenez was always clear that it would take time for entresto to gain momentum there has so far been no retreat from his long term target for peak annual sales of  bn from the drug others are no longer as confident citigroup last month slashed its entresto sales forecast from  bn in   to just  bn the worry for investors is that entresto weak start may be harbinger of tougher times ahead in the us two much hyped cholesterol lowering drugs from sanofi andamgen have also been stuck in the slow lane since their launch last year this has added to evidence that us insurers and healthcare providers are becoming more aggressive in their bargaining with big pharma as structural changes in the health system increase incentives for cost savings without strong contribution from entresto this year novartis has been left badly exposed to decline at alcon business acquired from nestl for  bn in two part transaction completed in   mr jimenez announced change of leadershipat the unit in january and narrowed its focus to contact lenses and surgical equipment while its eye drugs were transferred to the main pharma division target was set for alcon to return to growth by the end of the year and mr jimenez insisted that eyecare remained an attractive market given rising demand from an ageing world population however seamus fernandez analyst at leerink says the business may be sold if the turnround falters further uncertainty comes from the series of investigations facing novartis over suspected marketing abuses in the us turkey and south korea that is on top of  m settlement paid to the us securities and exchange commission last month for bribery in china and suspension of its business in japan last year as punishment for manipulating clinical trial data by far the biggest peril is from lawsuit being pursued by preet bharara the formidable us attorney general for the southern district of new york he has accused novartis of funnelling kickbacks to prescribers through as many as     sham educational meetings where doctors were wined and dined mr bharara has already secured  m settlement from novartis in separate case last year and andrew baum analyst at citigroup says there is high probability of another fine that could be similar in scale to the record  bn paid byglaxosmithkline to the us justice department in   like gsk novartis might also have to commit to marketing reforms that would make it harder to aggressively push entresto mr baum said this could severely impact earnings and cast reputational shadow over the incumbent novartis chairman joerg reinhardt and ceo in an attempt to clean up novartis has appointed chief ethics officer and is in the process of tightening its rules on relations with doctors for all the challenges some analysts still see reasons for optimism while entresto has flopped so far another new product cosentyx for psoriasis has started strongly with forecasts of    bn in annual sales by   michael nawrath analyst at rcher kantonalbank says mr jimenez could refresh the business with bolt on deals it doesn have to

anything to go by and it is then the aussie budget in couple of months time could be just as big whatever happens in the upcoming aussie budget my take is they ll follow suit with the uk most talked about new tax the sugar tax first things first let quickly recap why the sugar tax is even thing the world health organisation who regards childhood obesity as one of the most serious and significant global challenges of the  st century their concerns are just in the uk the national child measurement program ncmp measures the height and weight of around one million schoolkids every year their     results were truly shocking approximately     of children aged     were obese around     were overweight for kids aged         were obese and     overweight in the uk around one in three kids are obese or overweight the australian institute of health and welfare report that   of australian children are obese or overweight they rate it as higher burden of disease than smoking this is problem everywhere who do you blame the food industry my view on the childhood obesity epidemic is pretty black and white and sometimes unpopular if you underfeed your kid it child abuse if you overfeed them it the same there no two ways about it as parents you are responsible for the health and safety of your kids there no question that childhood obesity is global problem long term it a significant issue for government welfare and healthcare systems the university of maryland medical centre lists the side effects of obesity type   diabetes high blood pressure coronary artery disease high cholesterol high levels of fat in the blood heart failure respiratory problems now imagine whole generation of kids living with this in life it will result in death far earlier than necessary it will also result in incredible strain on healthcare systems the independent reports that in the uk the bill for obesity related illnesses reaches    bn year the journal of occupational and environmental medicine highlights compared to nonsmokers average health costs were     higher for smokers the incremental costs associated with obesity were even higher     more than for normal weight individuals for those with morbid obesity the excess costs were up to     per year it all just as bad in australia the national health and medical research council states   report by the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd predicts that there will be continued increases in overweight and obesity levels across all age groups during the next decade in australia to around   of the population they go on to explain that data from the australian diabetes obesity and lifestyle ausdiab study indicate that the total direct cost for overweight and obesity in   was   billion     billion for overweight and     billion for obesity the same study estimated indirect costs of     billion per year resulting in an overall total annual cost of     billion colagiuri et al   the world is getting fat kids are getting fat parents are getting fat this fat epidemic is killing us and killing economies someone needs to put stop to it but who who do you blame who the scapegoat here where the easy out taking the easy route arguments are this is an industry problem if food and beverage industries didn pack so much sugar into food and drink the problem wouldn be as bad this line of argument has led the british government to world first sugar tax the tax will come in from   and any soft drink with more than five grams of sugar per  ml is in trouble the bbc reports that the office for budgetary responsibility suggests the levy will add  p au     or  p au     per litre or about  p au     or  p au     to standard  ml can that means for red bull pepsi or coke around  p au     per can will be added to the price this is serious tax generation policy for the uk estimates are it will raise   million au     billion per year in extra revenue the aim is it will go towards promoting and developing sports in schools if that true well we ll see how it plays out taxing parents doesn win an election the uk has set bar that believe other countries around the world will now follow and think that australia will be next the timing is perfect precedence has been set all scott morrison needs to do is just follow suit imagine if this rolls out worldwide in   red bull sold     billion cans of red bull do the maths if every red bull had   cent tax added it would raise     billion and that just red bull add it to coke pepsi mountain dew monster and rockstar it would mean billions around the world in tax revenue think this sugar tax is all posturing it reeks of political vote grabbing when you boil it down sugar tax won really reduce the occurrence of obesity but it will take good decade or so to see that meanwhile it will raise billions for the government while making what looks like socially responsible move britvic plc lon bvic drinks maker plunged from     to     within   hours of the announcement g barr plc lon bag who make the popular irn bru is down over   since wednesday sure soft drinks are high in sugar but so is chocolate chips white bread pasta sauce tomato sauce cake fruit juice and whole range of other foods that are just as bad for kids the buck really stops with parents the best and only way to tackle childhood obesity is through parents you want to tax something to tackle obesity increase the income tax on parents with obese kids see how well that goes down with voters the sugar tax in the uk will stay it will continue to be vote grab

       " 'a little more than year ago my colleagues and started the streetcred police killings in context data project there were already several projects tracking police shootings including fatal encounters and new projects at the washington post and the guardian but we felt that they left out crucial context why did the police become involved in these incidents in the first place was their use of force something that most people would consider reasonable such as the police response after mohammad youssef abdulazeez opened fire on military personnel at chattanooga tenn recruiting station or was it unreasonable as with the shameful killing of walter scott the most common criticism received was that it was an attempt to demonstrate that police aren the problem m white texas cop so that not an unreasonable presumption but hope you ll see that what we found can steer the conversation toward more productive and meaningful reforms we began as others did with the fatal encounters database where the post pulitzer prize winning effort focused on police shootings we focused on all police related deaths and where the guardian included killings by for example prison guards or traffic accidents or personal disputes between officers we focused only on official acts on or off duty by police officers ultimately we gathered more than   contextual data points from the mundane middle name to the specific if the person was listed as mentally ill was it previously diagnosed serious mental illness or merely suspected we eventually identified   cases in which unarmed civilians had died after an encounter with police in   we now had wealth of contextual data that we believed could add lot to the ongoing dialogue about police shootings we think the context for these shootings transcends both race and politics we have assembled our findings in book in context understanding police killings of unarmed civilians which we believe is instructive for activists police officers and use of force trainers the context behind these shootings can also help readers understand how police and trainers approach these cases and the applicable law they use to determine when different levels of force are justified we tried to be objective but true objectivity is of course impossible everyone has inherent bias instead we ve tried to be as open and transparent as we can we included more than   source footnotes in the book as well as an open update system to track when we got something wrong the data methodology and schema on which we based our conclusions are all open and available under the creative commons share alike license so please feel free to check our work from my interpretation of the data there are some relatively easy changes police and policymakers can make that will go long way toward improving policing in the united states here are what you might call the low hanging fruit police must release more data and do it sooner when agencies delay public suspicion and speculation fill the void every time police choose transparency it a deposit in the bank of goodwill it builds community trust las vegas has shown that police department can be transparent and forthcoming after police shooting without disrupting the integrity of the investigation honesty begins with timely release of the earliest available information that might include timeline recordings of   calls narrative and any video without video or   calls the public has nothing but the word of the police and as we have seen police do sometimes lie not always not even lot according to our research but consider the walter scott shooting and the apparent lies told by officer michael slager high profile case like that can quickly make citizens lose faith in the system sunlight is the best disinfectant while the media and activists groups often focus on race the data show greater disparity in deadly engagements with drug addicts and the mentally ill in   nearly half   percent of the deaths of unarmed civilians after police encounter involved someone suffering from serious mental illness overdosing on drugs or both we tend to think of both mental health and drug addiction to be issues at the margins of society these issues need far more social legal and policy attention than they re getting one approach gaining popularity is the memphis model crisis intervention team cit for first responders under the cit model police officers are trained how to recognize the symptoms of mental illness crisis how to communicate with people experiencing mental health crisis and how to intervene without escalating the model has been widely praised and should continue to be adopted around the country but it is clear that the problem is bigger than just crisis management the work needs to start before mentally ill person goes into crisis in the first place we re also seeing new programs to address that problem with promising results program in the mid cities between dallas and fort worth for example has been successful in training cops on new ways to liaise with the mentally ill by focusing on wellness checks in addition to crisis management the area has seen reduction in acute mental health crisis hospitalizations such creative programs stress regular visits and include outreach to friends and family it a really smart way to work it saves lives and money and arguably makes the community more strongly supportive of all its residents many state police academies have also been adding more training in mental health and disability in my opinion we need more of these programs and with an even broader focus but even with new training we must remember that the police should be the last line of defense from mentally ill people who potentially pose threat to the community instead police are too often the first the federal government has long passed the buck on mental health to the states under both democratic and republican administrations state governments have also dropped the ball mental illness is society wide issue it can just be police issue the buck can be passed down but cops can pass the buck back up and if we are going to insist on asking cops to respond to mental health crises the least we can do is give them the proper training and support look at all disability not just mental illness when we add physical disability such as pulmonary emphysema enlarged heart hypertensive or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease thyroid disorder to that statistic the number of unarmed citizens who died after police encounter suffering from drugs mental illness and or physical disability is   percent that of course is more than half we need to consider as society the effects our national health care policies can have on policing we also need to be make sure police are properly trained to interact with people with disabilities such as deafness or autism health care and policing aren unrelated issues cops alone can change this it should be part of the larger conversation among activists health care professionals journalists and law enforcement leaders while it true that fixing the american health care system isn exactly low hanging fruit one fix that would go long way is better coordination among police health care providers and advocacy groups for people with disabilities the americans with disabilities act isn a suggestion it a mandate it time our society faces the fact that when it comes to the cops it cannot be mandate that is unfunded and unsupported we need more police video but it must be used correctly video was available only in   percent of the cases in which an unarmed person died after an encounter with police in two   cases eyewitness shot video was crucial in showing that officers had lied to investigators in two other cases video exonerated officers but in all four of these cases the video was taken by bystanders or surveillance cameras not by police operated video here another metric first observed by san jose independent police auditor walter katz last year there were zero indictments of police officers in cases that did not involve video in every case in which an officer was indicted video was available and became an important part of the evidence supporting indictment that an important metric we need more officer video in more places right now believe proliferation of body and dash cam cameras will mostly demonstrate that police usually get it right and perform their jobs with professionalism but it will also show when we are at our worst that too is important am strong proponent of body worn video but it not as easy as merely handing out the cameras as we ve already seen there are significant challenges to developing practical policies and procedures that bring transparency while still protecting citizen privacy and police officers due process rank and file officers union representatives where appropriate and community leaders and activists should be consulted during the policy building process so that there are no surprises sometimes policy can be counterintuitive for truly surprising read have look at the how the los angeles sheriff department handled the thorny issue of whether officers should be permitted to view video before writing their reports there are also logistical technological and financial barriers that need hashing out deaths in police custody aren always from shootings police shootings get most of the media coverage but in nearly half of the   cases in which cops killed an unarmed citizen in   no shots were fired at all the decedent was killed in another manner in most of these cases autopsy reports found that the deceased had an abnormal reaction or complication after officers deployed tools or techniques with the intent of using of non deadly force such as stun guns or chemical spray many of these cases include the drug related mental health related deaths described previously as well as other incidents in which decedents with chronic health conditions or physical disability attacked or resisted officers or others in   of the   cases   percent in which there were shootings officers deployed taser prior to shooting to my colleagues and me this is good indication that officers were attempting to subdue suspects who ultimately died by first using non deadly force that would be consistent with current best practices that conclusion has frustrated some observers because activists and reformers have pointed to tasers as weapons that cause too many deaths part of the problem is that there a lot of confusion in the general public about weapon potential to cause death and whether it should be considered deadly force by law practice and training without devolving into festival of scholarly citations the law is quite clear about this deadly force is force that poses significant risk of death or serious bodily injury legal experts have tended to agree that significant risk means more likely than not some people have indeed died proximate to taser exposure but the numbers are very small independent non taser funded research has repeatedly shown that the percentage of people exposed to taser who die soon after that exposure is minuscule and even among those cases it difficult to establish causal link see for example this arizona state university study or this nij study there have been millions of taser exposures and very few deaths in definition and in practice taser is non deadly force our data show that in nearly third of the cases in which officers used deadly force they first attempted non deadly force yes there have been awful examples of taser proximate injuries suffered when an officer used the weapon not because suspect was fighting but to gain control or out of anger that is generally fireable offense and sometimes criminal act but that a separate issue from the cases my team studied in which police officers faced real threat and deployed taser to stop potentially deadly incident by using non deadly force consider if you will the death of omar lopez last year lopez had been fighting passenger on the septa train in philadelphia when police officer intervened lopez bit and violently fought with the officer the officer armed with   sig sauer pistol and baton continued to struggle and ultimately used his taser alone lopez died but the autopsy showed his cause of death to be an overdose of pcp that officer like officers in many of the incidents we studied showed tremendous restraint when we credit officers who first opt for non deadly force others are less likely to reach first for their guns think reasonable people would agree each of these reforms is individually actionable none is dependent on the others and few seem all that divisive or controversial with couple of exceptions the solution for each is relatively inexpensive relatively uncomplicated and relatively understandable once we can see beyond the how many of police involved killings and look instead to the why we can start to have meaningful conversations about how to reduce them https www washingtonpost com news the watch

       " 'warning signs can vary wildly between men and women both men and women can experience chest pain when they are having heart attack but other symptoms can significantly vary according to the university of alabama dr joseph fritz if you think of someone having heart attack chances are you will picture scene where man gasps clutches his chest and falls to the ground but in reality heart attack victim could easily be woman and the scene not be so dramatic while men and women share some of the same symptoms the university of alabama dr joseph fritz explains they can also have wildly different ones both men and women can suffer chest tightness and pain or pressure in the chest neck jaw arms or back unusual fatigue shortness of breath coughing feeling sick and vomiting are among the unpleasant symptoms experienced by both genders other major symptoms for men include weakness breaking out into cold sweat dizziness major symptoms for women include sleep disturbance indigestion anxiety however dr fritz also urged people to remember each heart attack is different and symptoms may not always exactly fit the mould never ignore any possible symptoms of heart attack and get medical attention immediately women heart attack symptoms can include indigestion and sleep disturbance which can be mistaken for signs of something else women are likely than men to die within year of their first attack women are more likely than men to die within year of their first heart attack according to the american heart association that is because while both genders experience chest pain as the primary symptom women often have atypical vague symptoms as well such as back or jaw pain nausea or sense of dread earlier this year dr laxmi mehta of ohio state university said these symptoms can be very challenging for the patient and the medical profession women tend to under recognise or deny them when they do present to the emergency department it is important for these symptoms to be triaged appropriately as potential heart problems otherwise the consequences are misdiagnosis delayed treatment and higher death rates even things considered more minor health problems such as sexual health bleeding gums and even snoring could be sign of poor heart health when the heart and arteries begin to fail symptoms manifest in otherwise unrelated parts in the body revealed dr john erwin cardiologist from texas m health science center dr erwin revealed six of the most common and most surprising symptoms of heart disease that people need to be aware of keeping an eye out for these problems can lead to earlier detection of the disease and help save lives symptom   sexual dysfunction many people think of sexual dysfunction as problem of the reproductive organs or the brain however especially in males sexual dysfunction is common symptom of arterial disease erectile dysfunction is typically thought to be problem of the brain or reproductive system however it can also occur because of buildup of plaque in the arteries which can lead to cardiovascular disease buildup of plaque in the arteries can cause men to have hard time achieving or maintaining erection but for women drop in libido usually signals post menopausal state yet women who are post menopausal rapidly increase their risk factors for developing heart disease menopause itself doesn cause cardiovascular disease dr erwin said while menopause doesn cause cardiovascular diseases certain heart health risks like changes in blood pressure and cholesterol levels begin around the time of menopause furthermore many women develop more sedentary lifestyle in that phase of their lives as result this symptom should not be ignored symptom   snoring or sleep apnea few things are more frustrating in life than trying to sleep next to snoring person however on top of the annoyance of snoring dr erwin revealed it can actually be sign of heart disease snoring is common sign of sleep apnea as is morning sleepiness after full night sleep dr erwin said sleep apnea periods of time during sleep where you stop breathing is associated with many physiological changes that increase the risk of both heart attack and stroke snoring may be annoying but it is symptom of sleep apnea which can often signify heart disease snoring can also be sign of atrial fibrillation which is an irregular often rapid heart rate that causes poor blood flow therefore detection and treatment of sleep apnea can lower person risk of heart problems so next time you hear the person next to you snoring perhaps suggest they see doctor instead of just complaining about the noise symptom   bleeding sore or swollen gums few people would ever think that gum problems could be linked to heart disease however unhealthy gums are symptom of periodontis that is serious gum infection that damages the gums and can destroy the jawbone periodontis can actually lead to an increase in inflammation across the body according to dr erwein and over activity of inflammatory pathways is strong risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic heart disease and heart attack thus it recommended that people follow up regularly with their dentist for oral hygiene they should also regularly brush and floss their teeth symptom   shoulder or neck constriction or aching many people feel like an elephant is sitting on their chest during heart attack and many others experience squeezing sensation in their arms however not all people go through those classic heart attack feelings constriction or aching in the shoulder or neck or swollen and bleeding gums may appear to be minor health problems but in reality they can be symptoms of heart disease and should be checked out by doctor instead many heart attack sufferers feel an uncomfortable sensation achiness pain or pressure in their neck jaw or shoulders for some that discomfort is the only sign of heart pain or heart attack symptom   puffy feet and legs feet and legs can swell for variety of reasons including something as minor as heat however puffy legs and feet can also be marker of congestive heart failure that particularly true in cases where person has unusual shortness of breath with activity or when trying to sleep while it also true that some swelling occurs naturally throughout the day and tends to resolve overnight persistent swelling is problematic people who have constant or worsening swelling of the feet or legs should see doctor for an evaluation of heart failure symptom   indigestion or heartburn heartburn and indigestion are quite common and rarely serious but in some instances those seemingly benign burning or aching sensations in the upper abdomen can be sign of heart pain or heart attack additionally persistent gastrointestinal distress such as intractable hiccups can also be precursor and so when heartburn indigestion or hiccups are mixed with nausea sweating shortness of breath or lightheadedness people should seek medical attention dr erwin said it not uncommon to see people come into the emergency room after chewing on antacids for hours before they realize the pain is

       " 'selenium is trace element and mineral that is essential for human life   it is critical to many of our basic physiological functions including protecting cells from oxidative stress and helping the thyroid produce hormones it is found in many selenium rich fruits and vegetables and some animal products to say that selenium is important is an understatement low selenium levels are actually linked to conditions such as keshan disease   heart disease   and infertility   let look at what selenium means to your health   selenium is powerful antioxidant selenium works as powerful antioxidant in the body   antioxidants are substances that slow or prevent cell damage by neutralizing free radicals selenium protects against free radicals and oxidative stress it an active immunomodulator and more potent antioxidant than vitamins c or   selenium combines with other proteins to create selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases these proteins act as antioxidants to support health at the cellular level     thyroid support the thyroid is gland in the throat that produces hormones the hormones produced by the thyroid affect growth and metabolic processes compared to other tissue in the human body the thyroid contains the most selenium per gram   like iodine selenium plays an important role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones there have been many studies on selenium and thyroid disease often with mixed or contradictory results one study linked low selenium levels to thyroid problems in the elderly unfortunately in that instance selenium supplementation did little to help   however another study found that selenium supplementation during pregnancy reduced hypothyroidism and inflammation   yet another study found selenium supplementation decreases the negative effects of hashimoto thyroiditis   more research is needed to draw conclusions but the potential of selenium as it relates to thyroid health is encouraging   anti aging properties of selenium free radical damage causes the cellular degeneration we know as aging   as powerful antioxidant selenium neutralizes the damaging effects of free radicals one study revealed that selenium levels decline with age and low selenium contributes to cognitive decline in older adults     there is great interest in determining whether selenium supplementation can slow age related mental impairment hopefully we learn more soon   encourages metal detoxification metals are among the most toxic of pollutants effective ways to detoxify the body of toxic metals are few and far between the good news data suggests that supplementing with organic carbon bound selenium supports mercury excretion     cardiovascular support it clear that there is relationship between selenium concentration and cardiovascular health some heart attack patients show low selenium levels   and incidences of heart failure caused by selenium deficiency have been reported since as early as     not only is selenium itself important for cardiovascular support it works with other nutrients such as vitamin and beta carotene to help promote normal cholesterol levels     reproductive health selenium is critical for both male and female reproductive health it enables sperm locomotion and selenium deficiency can lead to male infertility   studies have found that low selenium can also have negative impact on female fertility and fetal growth   there seems to be link between selenium deficiency and miscarriage but more research is necessary to determine the exact mechanism     selenium and cancer studies have observed trend in which lower concentrations of selenium correlated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer     although this is an interesting tidbit of information it shouldn be interpreted as an implication that selenium is treatment or method of prevention for cancer while selenium has many benefits there is not conclusive evidence to call it viable treatment option how selenium benefits your health we do know that selenium is an essential mineral that crucial to many bodily functions natural sources like fruits and vegetables are the best way to incorporate selenium into your diet selenium supplementation may also be appropriate for people who are experiencing selenium deficiency   if you re concerned that you

between nerve cells the drugs block the chemical acetylcholine which is involved in the transmission of electrical impulses between nerve cells the treatments are prescribed for wide range of conditions including parkinson disease overactive bladder chronic obstructive pulmonary disease nausea and vomiting sleeping problems high blood pressure depression and psychosis but the authors warn use of ac anti cholinergic medication among older adults should likely be discouraged if alternative therapies are available previous studies have linked the drugs with cognitive impairment increased risk of dementia and falls however the new study by indiana university school of medicine is the first to explore their impact on brain metabolism and atrophy through brain scans dr shannon risacher the university assistant professor of radiology and imaging sciences said these findings provide us with much better understanding of how this class of drugs may act upon the brain in ways that might raise the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia given all the research evidence physicians might want to consider alternatives to anticholinergic medications if available when working with their older patients the impact of these drugs have been know about for over decade with   study finding drugs with strong anticholinergic effect cause cognitive problems when taken continuously for as few as   days drugs with weaker effect could cause impairment within   days many over the counter medicines have been linked to slower brain processing times and smaller brains the new study involved   participants   of whom were taking at least one medication with medium or high anticholinergic activity the participants were drawn from national alzheimer research project the alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative and the indiana memory and ageing study to identify possible physical and physiological changes that could be associated with the reported effects researchers assessed the results of memory and other cognitive tests positron emission tests pet measuring brain metabolism and magnetic resonance imaging mri scans for brain structure patients taking anticholinergic drugs performed worse than older adults not taking the drugs on short term memory and some tests of executive function which cover range of activities such as verbal reasoning planning and problem solving anticholinergic drug users also showed lower levels of glucose metabolism biomarker for brain activity in both the overall brain and in the hippocampus region of the brain associated with memory and which has been identified as affected early by alzheimer disease the researchers also found significant links between brain structure revealed by the mri scans and anticholinergic drug use with the participants using anticholinergic drugs having reduced brain volume and larger ventricles the cavities inside the brain professor risacher added these findings might give us clues to the biological basis for the cognitive problems associated with anticholinergic drugs but additional studies are needed if we are to truly understand the mechanisms involved the study was published in the journal jama neurology john smith chief executive of the proprietary association of great britain which represents makers of over the counter medicines said the medicines linked to the study were not intended to be used on daily basis anticholinergic medicines include some over the counter allergy and cold and flu products however they are intended for short term relief of symptoms only he said it is important to note that the jama study only involved people with mean age of   in what the researchers conceded was small sample the study followed people who took medicines that were low medium or high in anticholinergic activity and concluded that the use of medication with medium or high anticholinergic activity should be discouraged in older adults if alternative therapies are available however due to the study limitations the researchers propose that further and more advanced studies are needed anticholinergic medicines include some over the counter allergy and cold and flu products but these are intended for short term relief of symptoms and not for continuous use as in the research if anyone has any concerns about their medicine we would advise them to talk to their pharmacist

       " 'glycine the muscle building brain boosting amino acid that benefits the entire body while you may not be familiar with the term specifically you use glycine every day to strengthen your body and frankly allow it to work properly this amino acid is essential for many different muscle cognitive and metabolic functions it helps break down and transport nutrients like glycogen and fat to be used by cells for energy and in the process it supports strong immune digestive and nervous systems in the human body glycine is found in high concentrations in the skin connective tissues of the joints and muscle tissue one of the key amino acids used to form collagen and gelatin glycine can be found in bone broth and other protein sources in fact glycine along with many other nutrients like proline and arginine is part of what gives superfood bone broth its amazing healing abilities glycine benefits uses according to research done by the departments of cell and developmental biology at the university of north carolina at chapel hill glycine can be used to help lower symptoms in people suffering from conditions like ulcers arthritis leaky gut syndrome diabetes kidney and heart failure neurobehavioral disorders chronic fatigue sleep disorders and even certain cancers   amino acids such as glycine can be found in supplement form but it easy and probably even more beneficial to acquire them from natural food sources some of the many health benefits of glycine include helping build lean muscle mass preventing scaropenia muscle loss muscle wasting or deterioration playing role in the production of human growth hormone boosting mental performance and memory helping prevent strokes and seizures protecting skin from signs of aging or cellular mutations protecting collagen in joints and reducing joint pain improving flexibility and range of motion stabilizing blood sugar and lowering risk for type   diabetes improving sleep quality lowering inflammation and free radical damage by increasing glutathione production reducing risk for certain types of cancer building the lining of the gastrointestinal tract producing bile salts and digestive enzymes helping reduce allergic and autoimmune reactions boosting energy levels and fighting fatigue helping produce red blood cells fighting the effects of stress and anxiety helping control symptoms of seizures schizophrenia and mental disorders among all of these benefits here are several key ways glycine is used in the body   promotes muscle growth glycine has been found to help inhibit the deterioration of valuable protein tissue that forms muscle and boosts muscle recovery in fact it known as an anti aging amino acid because of how it helps maintain lean muscle mass into old age stimulates the secretion of human growth hormone prevents loss of cartilage in joints and even improves daytime energy physical performance and mental capabilities all important for athletes     glycine is used during the biosynthesis of creatine which provides muscles with direct source of fuel to repair damage and grow back stronger it also helps provide cells with energy thanks to its role in the conversion of nutrients from your diet helping feed hungry muscle tissues and boosting endurance strength and performance it also has benefits when it comes to hormone production and regulation helping the body naturally synthesize steroid hormones that regulate the ratio of fat to muscle mass and control energy expenditure     repairs and protects joints and cartilage together with other amino acids found in bone broth especially proline glycine plays part in the formation of collagen promoting the growth and function of joints tendons and ligaments approximately one third of collagen is composed of glycine and collagen is crucial for forming connective tissue that keeps joints flexible and able to withstand shock this is why collagen hydrolysate is often used for the treatment of degenerative joint diseases like osteoarthritis   as people get older it especially important to consume enough proteins amino acids in order to repair damaged tissues within joints that suffer due to ongoing free radical damage glycine is essential for the formation of stretchy flexible cartilage helps heal damaged joints and can prevent loss of mobility and functionality in older adults     improves digestion amino acids including glycine and proline help rebuild tissue that lines the digestive tract keeping food particles and bacteria inside the gut where they belong rather than allowing tiny openings to form that pass particles to the bloodstream where they trigger inflammation glycine helps form two of the most important substances that make up the gut lining collagen and gelatin collagen and gelatine help people with food allergies and sensitivities tolerate foods more easily can soothe the lining of the gi tract in people with inflammatory bowel diseases or indigestion including leaky gut syndrome ibs crohn ulcerative colitis and acid reflux and even promote probiotic balance and growth within the gi tract glycine also acts like metabolic fuel it needed to manufacture bile nucleic acids creatine phosphate and porphyrins to be used to break down nutrients from your diet for example it helps break down fats by aiding with the production of bile acids and helps transport glycogen to cells to be used for energy in the form of atp evidence also shows that glycine can help stabilize blood sugar levels leading to more lasting energy and preventing sugar cravings and fatigue   slows the effects of aging and builds the immune system glycine helps form glutathione valuable antioxidant that used to prevent cellular damage and various signs of aging   study published in the american journal of clinical nutrition found that although glutathione deficiency in elderly people occurs because of marked reduction in synthesis supplementation with the glutathione precursors cysteine and glycine fully restores glutathione synthesis this helps increase concentrations and lowers levels of oxidative stress and oxidant damages that lead to aging   in certain studies glycine has even been found to help prevent cellular mutations that lead to cancer there some evidence that using targeted amino acid therapy can prevent the growth of cancerous cells by cutting off their energy supply and help turn down inflammation which is linked to numerous other chronic conditions besides cancer   calms the nerves and feeds the brain glycine is beneficial for supporting cognitive performance and the central nervous system because of how it helps regulate the metabolic synthesis of certain nutrients that the brain and nerves use for energy it helps regulate nerve impulses throughout the body by balancing electrolyte levels such as calcium chloride and potassium due to its role in both nerve and neurotransmitter functions glycine also has implications for helping improve sleep mental performance bodily sensations moods memory and behaviors for example glycine works with other amino acids including taurine and gamma amino butyric acid gaba as an inhibitory neurotransmitter some evidence shows that glycine can help reduce hyperactivity in the brain and even play role in the treatment or prevention of mental disorders including learning disabilities schizophrenia bipolar disorder manic depression and epilepsy certain studies have shown that glycine helps reduce psychotic symptoms strokes and seizures when used with other supplements as part of holistic treatment plan for mental cognitive illness     fights fatigue and promotes restful sleep due to its roles in the central nervous system and the digestive system glycine can help boost energy levels balance blood sugar and prevent fatigue it can even be used to calm anxiety or nervousness that keeps you up at night and gets in the way of getting good sleep plus it helps directly bring nutrients to cells and tissue for energy at all times of the day according to research done by the japanese society of sleep research glycine supplements improve sleep quality lessen daytime sleepiness and improve performance of memory recognition tasks   one of its most important functions is helping carry out the biosynthesis of heme component of haemoglobin that helps produce and maintain red blood cells   red blood cells help carry oxygen around the body support cellular functions and provide the tissue heart and brain with energy in fact glycine is often used in supplements meant to improve energy in athletes fight fatigue caused by anemia and help regulate blood sugar levels what is glycine classified as non essential also called conditional amino acid glycine can be made in small amounts by the human body itself but many people can benefit from consuming lot more from their diets thanks to its numerous beneficial roles nutritional information and facts about glycine glycine is the second most widespread amino acid found in human enzymes and proteins which is why it has roles in nearly every part of the body   it one of   amino acids used to make protein in the body which builds the tissue that forms organs joints and muscles of the proteins in the body it concentrated in collagen the most abundant protein in humans and many mammals and also gelatin substance made from collagen some of the most attractive attributes include promoting better muscle growth healing the lining of the gi tract and slowing down the loss of cartilage in joints and skin while high protein foods like meat and dairy products do contain some glycine the best sources collagen and gelatin can be hard to get these proteins are not found in most cuts of meat and instead are obtained from consuming parts of animals that today most people throw away skin bones connective tissue tendons and ligaments people who are ill recovering from surgery taking medications that hinder certain metabolic processes or who are under lot of stress can all use extra glycine for recovery glycine recipes supplements getting more glycine into your diet is probably even easier than you think bone broth is great source of naturally occurring glycine and other amino acids is inexpensive simple to make at home and has far reaching health benefits bone broth which is made from slowly simmering animal parts including bones skin and tendons in stock contains natural collagen which releases important amino acids and other substances that are often missing from the typical western diet however if you re not willing to consume bone broth for example you re vegetarian or vegan glycine can be obtained from plant foods too plant based sources include beans vegetables like spinach kale cauliflower cabbage and pumpkin plus fruits like banana and kiwi other than bone broth glycine can also be found in complete sources of proteins animal proteins including meat dairy products poultry eggs and fish don forget that glycine is also found in high amounts in gelatin substance made from collagen that used in certain food products and sometimes for cooking or food prep gelatin isn commonly eaten in large amounts but can be added to recipes when making some gelatin desserts yogurts raw cheeses or even ice cream here are several simple recipes you can make at home to boost your glycine intake homemade chicken bone broth recipe homemade beef bone broth recipe kale chips recipe cauliflower pizza crust recipe turkey chili with adzuki beans recipe when it comes to glycine supplements and dosage recommendations here what you need to know while some foods especially animal proteins and bone broth do provide some glycine amounts tend to be small overall so you need to consume supplements if you want to obtain higher dose there is no established daily requirement or upper limit of glycine at this time it believed that most people already get around two grams of glycine daily from their diets but needs differ lot depending on someone level of activity and state of health   depending on the symptoms you re looking to resolve you might benefit from consuming   times the average amount or even more not all protein amino acid supplements are created equal always look for high quality brands sold from reputable companies and consume food based supplements whenever possible because glycine is natural amino acid there not much risk for consuming too much from your diet in supplement form higher doses of glycine between     grams have been used safely to help resolve chronic conditions like mental disorders but this amount should be taken with supervision from doctor it not known if giving glycine supplements to children pregnant or breast feeding women or people with kidney or liver disease is safe or good idea so avoid using glycine in these cases for now glycine supplements can also interact with certain medications when taken in high doses such as those used by people with mental disorders including clozapine although for most people glycine is very safe especially in food form if you take medications it always good idea to get your doctor opinion when you begin to use any supplements final thoughts on glycine glycine is conditional non essential amino acid found in bone broth meat poultry eggs dairy products and certain beans and veggies it helps form collagen and gelatin substances that are important for building connective tissue throughout the body glycine is beneficial in both food and supplement form for people with joint pain digestive disorders like ibs ibd or food sensitives fatigue trouble sleeping anxiety and low immunity there is no recommended daily amount of glycine or upper limit and studies have found that it can be used safely in high doses up to     grams daily when necessary however estimates show that most people eating standard western diet consume only about two grams of glycine from their diets daily most likely because concentrated sources like animal tendons skins and bones are often thrown out read next what is collagen   ways collagen can boost your health',\n",

both small steps and giant leaps forward but not all of those designs came to life while the hearts of their creators were still beating sometimes it was an abrupt death other times it was lack of funding or public interest some inventions were even vague or hastily scrawled designs in the originator notebook but many of them were finally built sometimes hundreds of years after that person died   viola organista leonardo da vinci notorious for being cryptic and vague the polymath leonardo da vinci included in his codex atlanticus around   the designs of an organ able of producing string sounds like violin but which operated with keyboard like piano leonardo having the attention span of true genius which is to say none at all never bothered building it however his designs although not extremely detailed gave good idea to future craftsmen about how to go about creating one around   an instrument called geigenwerk was built by the german hans haiden it resembled leonardo original idea but operated on slightly different mechanical principle the most faithful interpretation of da vinci schematics so far is the organ finished in   by slawomir zubrzycki   years after its intellectual father passed away truly unique organ it has raised no small amount of musicians eyebrows about how existing musical arrangements can be played with it   typewriter henry mill henry mill

vaguely described mill conception has been regarded as first clear proposal of creating what later came to be known as typewriter mill died in   but the potential existence of such machine got the attention of among others people trying to facilitate communication for blind people in   charles thurber constructed machine for this purpose finally in     years after mill death the americans

bridge isambard kingdom brunel one of britain most revered figures isambard kingdom brunel is considered the founding father of modern civil engineering he was only   years old when in   he was appointed project engineer for constructing bridge above the river avon in bristol after several rejections and conflicts with the committee tasked to approve submitted designs the clifton suspension bridge was not an easy project at the time of construction it had the longest span of any bridge in the world further delays and setbacks left the bridge unfinished at the time of his death being heavy smoker brunel died of stroke in   construction was continued based on brunel designs and the bridge was finally finished in   fitting memorial for the late engineer as well as an impressive landmark in its own right today standing   meters long between its two   meter high towers and   meters above the river its core infrastructure remains unaltered brunel had to push the limits of civil engineering to the point that even modern calculations leave engineers in awe of how perfectly accurate and balanced his designs were   lear fan   bill lear in the late   bill lear inventor and founder of the lear jet corporation had an idea for unique aircraft type made almost entirely of composite materials like carbon graphite it would have the same durability at about half the weight of typical aluminum alloys its twin engines and rear mounted propeller would make it about as fast as other jets at that time the us federal aviation administration having reservations about gearbox and aerodynamics performance refused to give the project the green light for production lear didn live long enough to perfect his dream dying of leukemia in   his desire to have the jet completed was so great that as dying wish he told his wife moya to finish it with the help of british government funding the prototype made its maiden flight in   never having entered commercial production three finished models are now in display at the museum of flight in seattle washington at the frontiers of flight museum in dallas texas and in the back lot of faa facility in oklahoma city   demologos

ship unlike any other heavily armed and armored and its twin hulls had paddlewheel between them the engine was on one hull while the boilers were on the other floating fortress well suited for local defense it weighed     displacement tons and was   meters long in   before the ship was completed fulton jumped in the icy waters of the hudson river to save friend who fell in struck by pneumonia which quickly developed into pulmonary tuberculosis he died the same year shortly after the demologos was fully finished and the navy renamed it the fulton to honor the inventor the warship never saw

way you eat how much you exercise how you manage stress and your exposure to environmental toxins all contribute to things like high cholesterol high blood pressure high blood sugar and of course heart disease the current way doctors treat heart disease is misguided because they treat the risk factors not the causes to think we can treat heart disease by lowering cholesterol lowering blood pressure and lowering blood sugar with medication is like mopping up the floor while the sink overflows instead we need to ask what causes these risk factors like high blood pressure high blood sugar or abnormal cholesterol in the first place spoiler alert these are not medication deficiencies we treat these problems with medication but studies have increasingly shown that treating these risk factors has only little benefit or none at all research shows changing your lifestyle can be more powerful intervention to prevent heart disease than any medication the epic study published in the archives of internal medicine studied how     people adhered to four simple behaviors not smoking exercising     hours week eating healthy diet and maintaining healthy weight adhering to those four behaviors alone prevented   percent of diabetes   percent of heart attacks   percent of strokes and   percent of all cancers likewise the interheart study published in the lancet in   followed     people in   countries researchers found changing lifestyle could prevent at least   percent of all heart disease other research shows lifestyle intervention becomes more effective than almost any other traditional medical intervention to reduce cardiovascular disease hypertension heart failure stroke cancer diabesity and deaths from all causes your environment in turn changes gene expression

       " 'new details possible treatment in the link between heart disease and sleep apnea people with obstructive sleep apnea are at significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease the relationship between the two conditions is complex and the mechanisms by which they may trigger or exacerbate one another are not yet well understood but the fundamental connection between osa and cardiovascular disease is strong studies indicated that obstructive sleep apnea is     times more prevalent among people with cardiovascular disease than those without research shows that the mortality rate for cardiovascular disease is higher among older adults who also have osa sleep apnea is linked to several cardiovascular conditions including high blood pressure arrhythmia heart disease heart failure and stroke two common conditions cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among adults in the united states obstructive sleep apnea affects an estimated   million or more s adults with the great majority of cases remaining undiagnosed and untreated deepening our understanding of the relationship between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease is critical to public health how osa may trigger heart disease recent research reveals new details in the relationship between heart disease and sleep apnea and also points to possible treatment for lowering cardiovascular risks for people with osa scientists at columbia university medical center found that statins type of drug used to treat cholesterol may reverse the damage done to the cardiovascular system that appears to occur as consequence of sleep apnea the scientists also identified new information about the process by which obstructive sleep apnea may inflict cardiovascular damage according to the study people with osa exhibit abnormalities in protein that helps to limit cellular inflammation the dysfunction with this particular protein known as cd  appears to leave people with obstructive sleep apnea more vulnerable to inflammation which is regarded as significant contributor to cardiovascular disease the study included   people including   with diagnosis of sleep apnea and   who did not meet the diagnostic criteria for osa scientists analyzed blood samples from all participants looking in particular at endothelial cells cells that line the interior walls of blood vessels the protein cd  is normally found in these cells lining blood vessel walls from within the cell lining cd  works to prevent the buildup of inflammatory proteins on the surface of cells scientists found that among people with obstructive sleep apnea cd  levels were elevated compared to those without osa researchers found something else both surprising and significant in people with sleep apnea cd  protein was found primarily within the interior section of blood vessel cells rather than in the cells lining as would have been expected and was the case among people without sleep apnea at greater distance from cell walls the cd  protein was less able to exert its protective effect against inflammation the result greater build up of inflammatory proteins on the cells of people with obstructive sleep apnea researchers found statins solution included in the study were small number of subjects with osa who were already being treated with statins among this sub group of sleep apnea sufferers researchers discovered that cd  remained in place in the lining of cells in position to inhibit inflammation similar to people without osa additional research found that in people with osa the inward migration of cd  is influenced by cholesterol this finding is important opening the possibility of statins use as therapy to prevent cardiovascular damage in people with obstructive sleep apnea further study needs to take place before we ll know whether statins can serve as viable treatment to prevent or reverse the cardiovascular damage from osa but this is promising lead more broadly this study also provides some much needed insight into the process by which obstructive sleep apnea affects cardiovascular health and function the disrupted breathing of osa obstructive sleep apnea involves repeated interruptions to normal breathing during sleep during sleep the airway temporarily narrows or closes altogether compromising or fully interrupting breath flow these episodes of shallow or paused breathing can last few seconds or more than minute in cases of mild sleep apnea breathing is interrupted between     times an hours in cases of moderate to severe sleep apnea breathing is interrupted     times an hour or more people with osa are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease as well as other serious medical conditions including type   diabetes and depression they are also at significantly greater risk for accident and injury in large part because of the tiredness and fatigue that accompany this sleep disorder undiagnosed and untreated why do so many cases of obstructive sleep apnea go undiagnosed often people with sleep apnea aren aware of their most obvious symptoms since they occur during sleep snoring and other sounds of disrupted breathing during sleep can be signs of sleep apnea bed partners are frequently the people who are aware of these symptoms before the sleepers themselves even when people are aware they snore or breathe with difficulty during sleep they too often don address these issues with their physicians and physicians themselves often don make the topic of sleep and questions about sleep disordered breathing priority during physicals and check ups what more many people aren aware of the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that exist in addition to snoring dry mouth or sore throat upon waking headaches especially in the morning severe tiredness during the daytime trouble with concentration memory problems mood issues including depression anxiety and irritability the regular presence of any of these symptoms even in the absence of snoring warrants conversation with physician treatment works for osa sleep apnea can wreak havoc with nightly rest undermining health and daily performance the good news is that osa can be treated effectively with number of different therapies cpap continuous positive airway pressure therapy is highly effective in reducing or eliminating sleep apnea and is generally the recommended treatment for more severe cases of osa other forms of pap or positive airway pressure are also used to treat osa oral appliances devices worn inside the mouth during sleep can also significantly improve sleep apnea and are increasingly recommended for mild and moderate sleep apnea as well as for people who have difficulty using cpap therapy positional therapy switching sleeping position is the simplest form of sleep apnea treatment and can be effective particularly in cases of mild osa airway obstructions and disrupted breathing are more likely to occur when sleeping on one back moving to side sleeping position can reduce the frequency of interrupted breathing episodes and may even resolve mild sleep apnea in some cases lifestyle modifications including losing weight also help to alleviate osa we need to improve our diagnosis rates osa and get more people into treatment for sleep apnea and the other health complications that often accompany the disorder this latest research provides some significant new insight into how sleep apnea works to undermine heart health and may indicate new way to treat and protect people with sleep apnea against cardiovascular risks sweet

       " 'by ashish jha md reducing hospital use because hospitals are expensive and often cause harm there has been big focus on reducing hospital use this focus has been the underpinning for numerous policy interventions most notable of which is the affordable care act hospital readmissions reduction program hrrp which penalizes hospitals for higher than expected readmission rates the motivation behind hrrp is simple the readmission rate the proportion of discharged patients who return to the hospital within   days had been more or less flat for years and reducing this rate would save money and potentially improve care so it was big news when as the hrrp penalties kicked in government officials started reporting that the national readmission rate for medicare patients was declining rising use of observation status but during this time another phenomenon was coming into focus increasing use of observation status when patient needs hospital services there are two options that patient can be admitted for inpatient care or can be admitted to observation when patients are admitted to observation they essentially still get inpatient care but technically they are outpatients for variety of reasons we ve seen decline in patients admitted to inpatient status and rise in those going to observation status these two phenomena drop in readmissions and an increase in observation seemed related and others spoke publicly about our concerns that the drop in readmissions was being driven by increasing observation admissions an analysis by david himmelstein and steffie woolhandler in the health affairs blog suggested that most of the drop in readmissions could be accounted for both by increases in observation status and by increases in returns to the emergency department that did not lead to readmission two months later piece by claire noel miller and keith lund also in the health affairs blog found that the hospitals with the biggest drop in readmissions appeared to have big increases in their use of observation status it seemed like much of the drop in readmissions was about reclassifying people as observation and administratively lowering readmissions without changing care new data now comes terrific high quality study in the new england journal of medicine that takes this topic head on the authors examine directly whether the hospitals that lowered their readmission rates were the same ones that increased their observation status and find no correlation none if you re ever looking for scatter plot of two variables that are completely uncorrelated look no further than figure   of the paper the best reading of the evidence prior to the study did not turn out to be the truth it reminds me of the period we were all convinced based on excellent observational data that hormone replacement therapy was lifesaving for women with cardiovascular disease and that became the standard of care until someoneconducted randomized trial and found that hrt provided little benefit to these patients that why we do research it moves our knowledge forward where are we now so where does this leave us is the aca readmissions policy home run here what we know the hrrp has most likely we have no controls led to fewer patients being readmitted to the hospital second the hrrp does not seem responsible for the increase in observation stays here what we don know is drop in readmissions good thing for patients it may seem obvious that it is but if you think about it you realize that readmission rate is utilization measure not patient outcome it a measure of how often patients use inpatient services within   days of discharge utilization measures unto themselves don tell you whether care is good or bad so the real question is has the hrrp improved the underlying quality of care it might be that we have improved on care coordination communications between hospitals and primary care providers and ensuring good follow up that likely happened in some places alternatively it might be that we have just made it much harder for that older frail woman with heart failure sitting in the emergency room to get admitted if she was discharged in the last   days that too has likely happened in some places but how much of it is the former versus the latter until we can answer that question we won know whether care is better or not beyond understanding why readmissions have fallen we also don know how hrrp has affected the other things that hospitals ought to focus on such as mortality and infection rates if your parent was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia what would be your top priority most people would say that they would like their parent not to die the second might be to avoid serious complications like healthcare associated infection or fall that leads to hip fracture another might be to be treated with dignity and respect yes avoiding being readmitted would be nice but for me at least it pales in comparison to avoiding death and disability we know little about the potential spillover effects of the readmission penalties on the things that matter the most so here we are good news study that says readmissions are down because fewer people are being readmitted to the hospital not because people are being admitted to observation status that important but the real challenge is in figuring out whether patients are better off are they more likely to be alive after hospitalization do they have fewer functional limitations less pain and suffering until we answer those questions it ll be hard to know whether this policy is making the kind of difference we want and that the point of science using data to answer those questions because we all can have our opinions but

       " 'cheese   or why the french were right the command say cheese is phrase so commonly used to elicit smile that today it is understood from the simple imperative cheese but prior to the  s such photographic cajolery was unknown indeed in the preceding victorian era the desirable beauty standard was considered tightly pursed orbicularis oris muscle whether because of poor dentition or the prim and proper societal norms of the time or some combination of both smiles were only for children peasants and drunks and until very recently the prevailing conventional wisdom for healthy eating relegated consuming cheese to failing of the ignorant simple or misguided from the late  s through the  s there was mandate from the experts and powers that be to consume less fat and particularly saturated fat principally those derived from animal sources such as meat poultry and dairy that admonishment has continued to echo and drive our poor culinary choices over the ensuing half century like an unresolved daddy issue an uncomplicated historical glance would have revealed that modest living fermented food like real cheese had helped sustain and advance human kind across civilizations and across the globe while large portion of the world population is lactose intolerant and therefore unable to consume or potentially benefit from raw or fresh milk products cheeses and particularly aged cheeses are an exception the milk sugar or lactose is utilized by beneficial bacteria lactobacillus comes to mind along with the fats most of which are saturated and proteins and through the process of fermentation raw milk undergoes the transformation from raw milk product to cheese as certain cheeses age there is often less lactose present so much so that for many even those who are lactose intolerant and unable to tolerate fresh milk such delicious pillows of probiotic loaded goodness can be enjoyed for the last half century real cheeses have been discounted as part of healthful approach to eating primarily because of their saturated fat and cholesterol content while the mediterranean diet was promoted as an ideal dietary model the dairy aspect of this gastronomy was shoved into corner where it lingered and mouldered often unappreciated is the historical fact that fermented dairy had long and prominent place in ancient diets such as the mediterranean this is because while fresh milk can be consumed it is quite perishable and much more valuable as raw material raw milk can be turned into several products like cream butter yogurts kefir whey and cheese all of which have substantially longer shelf life cheese reemerged from the shadows with the insights gleaned from the french paradox of the  s the french who drank wine and consumed butter cream and over   different kinds of cheese most of which are oh so stinky good all these tasty bits that were verboten in the us at the time had significantly less cardiovascular disease it turns out it was more than the wine dietary approach like mediterranean style cuisine rich in natural wholesome and fermented foods has been shown to reduce generalized inflammation and stress oxidative stress and inflammation play major roles in the onset and development of the diabetes and its precursor metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome is diagnosed by the presence of central obesity and at least two of the following four additional factors high triglycerides low hdl or good cholesterol high blood pressure or increased fasting plasma glucose concentration data from the recent european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition epic study examined     healthy and     diabetic participants from   european nations the researchers found an inverse association between cheese fermented dairy consumption and the incidence of diabetes eating only   d total of cheese and or yogurt was associated with   reduction in the incidence of type   diabetes new study just released revealed that just   daily of parmesan like italian cheese grana padano lowered blood pressure as effectively as the typically prescribed antihypertensive pharmaceutical this occurred even though the cheese contained the equivalent amount of sodium that would be found in consuming   ounce serving of potato chips previous studies had isolated some particular tripeptides in certain types of cheese and demonstrated relationship to being able to lower blood pressure these particular compounds are formed through the interaction of human gastrointestinal enzymes and the gut microbiota these peptide complexes have angiotensin converting enzyme inhibiting properties such ace inhibitors constitute an important class of medications that not only lower blood pressure but are foundation of therapy from those suffering from cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure from variety of causes another study examined almost     participants it examined the association between cheese consumption in various age groups and circulating concentrations of hdl or good cholesterol and triglycerides negative risk factor for cardiovascular disease the more cheese consumed the higher the hdl and the lower the triglycerides the researchers suggested that this was the result of the particular fatty acid composition of cheese and its inherent probiotic bacterial content the high protein and probiotic content of cheese is also believed to contribute to its almost neutral effect on plasma cholesterol even though cheese is high in cholesterol and saturated fat like so many other such natural foodstuffs its impact on blood lipids and total cholesterol is negligible some kinds of cheeses namely those infected with penicillium such as roquefort stilton or gorgonzola exhibit high concentrations of andrastins b and these are potent inhibitors of the enzyme farnesyltransferase this enzyme plays key role in cholesterol synthesis and its inhibition decreases cholesterol production in fact while the total cholesterol is overall minimally unchanged some studies suggest that consuming these types of foods shift the cholesterol towards the less inflammatory less atherogenic type an interesting observation arises from these studies the decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation markers is independent of body weight eating fat does not make you fat nor are the benefits simply the result of losing weight or caloric considerations the healthful effects also occur quite rapidly which suggests not just correlation but causation oligosaccharides which are also present in cheeses are prebiotics this is the food that sustains healthy gut microbiota it is what feeds the wee beasties cheeses which contain both prebiotics and probiotics become that gut microbiome superfood synbiotic another recently completed study demonstrated the cheese consumption directly altered the gut microbiome in an extremely favorable way certain gut bacteria are associated with the production of compound known as trimethylamine oxide or tmao the bacteria produce this compound in response to the dietary ingestion of choline levels of tmao have been found to correlate and are directly predictive of cardiovascular risk the consumption of cheese rapidly altered the composition of the gut microbiome there was significantly less tmao produced the positive changes to the gut microbiome associated with the regular consumption of such powerful wholesome naturally fermented synbiotic food as cheese may explain the relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease in high cheese

project but it will be my final attempt last do over if you will to overcome my many issue while chronicling my journey in an effort to showcase the seriousness of these issue the reality of what binge eating disorder looks like that it real the physical repercussions of having e the confusion of trying to figure out the best way to get healthy the overpowering stress of it all and the sometimes lack of available help to treat and defeat my particular forms of mental physical illness see warned you about run on sentences get ready for more am completely worn out mentally physically spiritually from my dealings with mental illness for what feels like forever ve tried so many times to get healthy and having ultimately failed every single time another failure will most like result in well let not think of that right now considering how young am it crazy to think of just how sick weak and old feel some of the stuff am dealing with physically doesn usually occur in people until they are much older and have lived long life of beating themselves up with poor diet drinking and smoking with my mental health issues and the resulting physical problems that stem from never overcoming those issues exist within an incredibly dangerous combination of crap perfect for an early death the great list of issue binge eating disorder e panic disorder kinda like having anxiety problems but this version is constant and relentless in it pursuit to rob you of any sort of peace and happiness you become distant sort of robot chronic depression when you re happy you re normal when you re sad you re very sad morbidly obese weighing as much as   lbs massive list of physical issues due to so many years of battling food addiction extreme weight changes the constant stress from everything mentioned above type   diabetes the only time m happy to settle for not being number one sleep apnea slightly enlarged heart due to the sleep apnea morbid obesity and diabetes high blood pressure constantly dizzy light headed highly inflammatory body in the danger zone for heart attack stroke extreme acid reflux weakened and inflamed throat esophagus sinus airways lungs from choking on acid in my sleep super fun way to wake up in the middle of the night skin disorder developed from poor diet high sugar in blood psoriasis like vision issues high blood pressure and diabetes are making my vision fade quickly bone joint issues hips popping out randomly tightness everywhere straight neck compressed lower back it all causes lots of numbness inability to move without pain or just not being able to move at all back muscle issues lower back gets strained pulled constantly can move can walk constantly winded feeling sick m always out of breath and feel dizzy or sick just talking makes me winded sometimes flushed face feels hot face always looks oddly red and flushed in comparison to the rest of my body around my eyes and my face always feels hot and somewhat numb to the touch persistent liver gallbladder pains something is going on in my liver gallbladder pancreas area the area is painful most of the time now and have symptoms of some scary stuff going on honestly there are probably more issue than that but whatever you get the idea at this point the deck is definitely stacked against me the odds of full recovery are not in my favor m sure if you re of more rational and sane mind you re probably thinking how the hell did you let yourself get that sick that fat that unhealthy well that what makes all of this so tricky it the necessary part of e food addiction which mental health professionals still won officially say exists that makes them bonafide mental illnesses you can overcome them alone and or you have to reach your own version of rock bottom to truly be able to get better even if you have moments where you can kinda see it like that guy in the predator movie there something in those trees you can try to get healthy lose weight work out but ultimately you fail you usually gain even more weight than before along with new accompanying physical problems that make sedentary lifestyle feel most comfortable and your e food addiction gains much greater hold over you you fall into an even deeper and darker hole and you feel almost powerless to try and overcome yourself your disease have tried so many times to figure out this puzzle up until almost two years ago there was virtually no help for someone with binge eating disorder it was just recently officially recognized as mental illness important side note doctors can be really dumb so beware if you were going to get any help at all you had to be assigned an illness you didn actually have they diagnosed me as bulimic even though told them never vomit or you had to pay out of pocket for an extremely expensive treatment facility but the chances of that fancy facility accepting males was virtually zero so if you were guy with e you were basically screwed now things are little different since e was officially claimed as mental illness there are couple commercials about e one of which is specifically trying to sell you some poisoned pills ll get into that another time there a nice website called neda that offers some assistance to those looking to find help for e though there was no place near me when last checked and health insurance has to accept your claim of being mentally ill now thus provide you with assistance getting help as for me am at place where ve finally accepting that can not in any way overcome my illness without serious help from mental health professionals ve actually always known that but until recently never had way to get the help that so desperately needed where mean m finally accepting that am helpless is in the following ve been trying to get myself clean by getting on healthy cleanse diet and overcoming the intense physical withdrawals feel when stop eating sugary and bad carb foods for me food addiction is no joke get very sick for nearly week with some wicked physically mental withdrawals for the last four months each time ve attempted this diet have failed have allowed that failure to hold myself back from admitting myself into an eating disorder clinic this is where am giving in see that the self sabotage part of my mind has been holding me back with this need to get clean before entering treatment it been kind of convenient excuse for the repetitive binge inducing diet failure ve been repeating for the last few months now no more prepping for my admittance to treatment tomorrow will be in contact with an eating disorder clinic to set up my admittance asap so there it is now we re all basically on the same page you know exactly what all m dealing with over the next however long it takes to get healthy ll be posting daily blogs regular vlogs on my youtube channel and random thought updates etc on facebook twitter ll include the links to everything on this page so feel free to follow along like subscribe and all that good stuff if you or anyone you know is struggling with binge eating disorder be sure to go to neda to find some helpful info and free hotline to call as for following along with my project maybe you ll discover something that helps you find your own way toward getting healthy or at least you ll realize that e and food addiction are both very real and very dangerous m definitely not doing any of this for popularity it actually quite humiliating to share all of this hope to be an example for the millions of people that knowingly or unknowingly struggle with what have to show how hard it is to exist with e food addiction mental illness and morbid obesity hopefully my experiences and brutal honesty along the way about what m dealing with and going through will help others most importantly this project will show everyone that this isn a problem that you can fix on your own you ll need help to truly recovery from such mental and physical issue it going to take multiple health professionals and the assistance of others that are caring and understand you re illness it takes community for me realize that ll have to piece together that community for myself but at least still have hope and that good enough for now feel free to contact me with any questions comments or concerns together we shall overcome love jay bee facebook page please like share

requiring labeling changes regarding the recommendations for metformin containing medicines for diabetes to expand metformin use in certain patients with reduced kidney function the current labeling strongly recommends against use of metformin in some patients whose kidneys do not work normally fda was asked to review numerous medical studies regarding the safety of metformin use in patients with mild to moderate impairment in kidney function and to change the measure of kidney function in the metformin drug labeling that is used to determine whether patient can receive metformin fda concluded from the review of studies published in the medical literature that metformin can be used safely in patients with mild impairment in kidney function and in some patients with moderate impairment in kidney function fda is requiring changes to the metformin labeling to reflect this new information and provide specific recommendations on the drug use in patients with mild to moderate kidney impairment fda is also requiring manufacturers to revise the labeling to recommend that the measure of kidney function used to determine whether patient can receive metformin be changed from one based on single laboratory parameter blood creatinine concentration to one that provides better estimate of renal function e glomerular filtration rate estimating equation egfr this is because in addition to blood creatinine concentration the glomerular filtration rate takes into account additional parameters that are important such as the patient age gender race and or weight see the fda drug safety

with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type   diabetes when untreated type   diabetes can lead to serious problems including blindness nerve and kidney damage and heart disease metformin containing medicines are available as single ingredient products and also in combination with other drugs used to treat diabetes the current drug labeling strongly recommends against metformin use in some patients whose kidneys do not work normally because use of metformin in these patients can increase the risk of developing serious and potentially deadly condition called lactic acidosis in which too much lactic acid builds up in the blood recommendation healthcare professionals should follow the latest recommendations when prescribing metformin containing medicines to patients with impaired kidney function patients should talk to their health care professionals if they have any questions or concerns about taking metformin the labeling recommendations on how and

       " 'in close     vote committee of medical experts said today that eteplirsen drug to treat duchenne muscular dystrophy has not met the bar set by the fda for approval which could make the drug the third duchenne treatment in recent months to face fda rejection adding to the frustration of tight knit and increasingly desperate community of patients and their advocates the committee one of many that help the fda evaluate drugs for approval wrestled today with question that in most other circumstances would never even merit consideration should the agency approve drug based on one trial with just   patients but the consideration was serious because duchenne is progressive fatal disease with no effective treatments or cure throng of patient advocates and others more than     strong showed up with more than   making their case at today hearing in hyattsville md suburb of washington dc that lasted more than   hours even the fda top drug official made rare appearance at the meeting weighing in with comments just before the vote still near term approval of eteplirsen developed by cambridge ma based sarepta therapeutics nasdaq srpt appears unlikely the recommendations of fda advisory panels are not binding but the agency typically sides with the experts decisions the   member panel voted   to   that sarepta hasn provided substantial evidence from adequate and well controlled studies that eteplirsen helps duchenne patients bodies create enough dystrophin the muscle protecting protein they lack to predict benefit just before the vote janet woodcock the director of the fda center for drug evaluation and research and key decision maker on drug approvals made clear that the matter at hand was accelerated approval process that allows the agency to green light drugs on thinner body of evidence the fda final decision due by may   will have significant implications for both the drug industry and thousands of patients with duchenne approval risks setting precedent for allowing drugs onto the market with bare minimum of human testing rejection means patients whose disease is death sentence lose more time before medicine is available respect the fda caution in setting precedent in approving new drugs but our kids are not precedent they are real live human beings and they are short on time said debra miller the ceo of the nonprofit newport beach ca organization cureduchenne at the hearing an fda official once told me the worst thing we can do is approve drug and then have to pull it off the market argue that the worst thing we can do is deny access to drug and then find out it works too late after we have lost generation of children the implications of this panel were clear from the start william dunn the director of the agency division of neurology products noted that regardless of how urgently drug is needed for duchenne the fda would not lower its approval standards nor would it take perverse delight in rejecting drug he knew what was coming emotions will run high dunn said children with duchenne their parents doctors and even some politicians spoke nearly all pleading for the agency to approve the drug one young patient responding to the agency criticism of eteplirsen effectiveness called the drug amazing and life changing can only guess you don know anything about duchenne he said as applause rang out while the panel voted against eteplirsen woodcock comments seemed to leave the door open for more evaluation in devastating diseases the consequences of this mistake can be extreme she said but most of these cons are borne by the patients that said the agency has already brushed patient and advocate pressure aside in rejecting two other duchenne drugs that were close to approval in january the agency said no to drisapersen drug from biomarin pharmaceutical nasdaq bmrn month later it rejected an approval application from ptc therapeutics nasdaq ptct on drug called ataluren both drisapersen and ataluren are meant to slow the grim march of duchenne in certain subgroups of patients the disease affects about     people worldwide primarily boys typically robs them of the ability to walk by their teens and eventually kills them through one of number of complications like respiratory or heart failure despite the pressing need for duchenne therapy data from the biomarin and ptc drugs just weren good enough for regulators the agency called biomarin drisapersen data inconsistent and in some cases contradictory and said ptc ataluren application was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review both drugs had failed phase   clinical trials but the companies claimed that post hoc analyses showed the drugs were benefitting patients since the february rejection of ptc all eyes have been on sarepta whose eteplirsen is also meant to slow the progression of duchenne in subset of patients group with specific genetic mutation about   percent of those with the disease sarepta original

produce wealth for the society the aam aadmi cares mostly about how he is fairing he sometimes compares himself to his friends but never to the filthy rich judging the lifestyle of others tempts one

to conform to the present scenario in which banks and financial institutions are working in india today such makeover for dicgc may have to factor in the resources at dicgc command at rs    crore is not small but it is inadequate to meet the business expansion the corporation may have to think of if the confidence deposit insurance should instil among depositors is to be restored dicgc may also have to revisit credit guarantee function it exited some time back in the changed environment ii since   there has been some effort to professionalise dicgc this need to be taken forward iii the anomalous situation arising from commercial banks meeting the cost of the inefficiency of cooperative banks will have to be rectified iv the corporation should apply its mind as to whether continuing the level of deposit insurance should be retained at low of rs one lakh perhaps the threshold should be raised to level to provide cover for at least   per cent of bank deposits corporation could

supervisory arms of rbi g warrier mumbai february     stop speculating on rbi apropos rbi guv and never ending speculation economic times money banking february   one wonders why et should join the speculators it is common knowledge that even in   when dr raghuram rajan was being tipped for the governor position there were other influential contenders and an opposing school of economists who were spreading all sorts of rumours against dr rajan they were again active during the first half of   gossiping about the possibility of change of guard at mint road post general election it is india good fortune that dr rajan survived the moves against him so far world has acknowledged that the leadership provided by dr rajan in the conduct of rbi affairs has been excellent if india decides and dr rajan accepts on longer term re appointment this paper should not have doubt about dr rajan capability to sort out his personal relationship with the university with which he has had an enduring relationship for the last two decades as any new incumbent governor in rbi takes minimum six months to settle down and the work in progress there now needs continuity in leadership goi may not think in terms of replacing dr rajan in september   and perhaps offer re appointment for longer tenure but reports like this can help gossip mongers and have some impact on the thought processes of economists and media which can influence economy adversely g warrier mumbai business standard february     banks health worries this refers to sudhir keshav bhave letter sinking ship february   this could be an example of how transparency in sensitive business like banking can spread panic the indian banking sector is not in as bad shape as is being made out by some analysts and external agencies major indian commercial banks including sbi have been able to meet all statutory requirements unlike their corporate co travellers banks are meeting their payment obligations on due dates and in the recent past there have been no bank failures in the commercial banking sector in india part of credit for this should go to the vigilant regulator this is not to argue that all is well as regards functioning of commercial banks there is immediate need to restore the health of the banking system impaired mainly by reluctance of big borrowers to make timely repayment and heavy burden on public sector banks psbs arising from workload and drain on resources in performance of social responsibilities there is no point in arguing now that the overhaul and professionalization of public sector banks psbs should have happened along with bank nationalisation and there should have been regular health checks and ongoing corrections just as health check up does not change the condition of person the re classification of more loans as npas does not alter bank ability to change the need of the hour is to support banks to recover their dues from borrowers who have the capacity to repay infuse professionalism in the banks working and restore the faith in the banking system as private sector banks have failed to perform their responsibilities and are not too willing to grow their share in banking business is less than   per cent privatising the existing public sector banks is no solution perhaps goi should consider nationalising entire banking business and restructuring the banking system to serve public interest g warrier mumbai iii self development suggestion shared by doctor worth accepting each individual must take note of the three minutes why is it important three minutes will greatly reduce the number of sudden deaths often this occurs when person who still look healthy has died in the night we hear stories of people suddenly die the reason is that when you wake up at night to go to the bathroom it is often done in rush immediately when stand up the brain lacks blood flow why three minutes is very important in the middle of the night when you are awakened by the urge to urinate for example ecg pattern can change because getting up suddenly the brain which is anaemic can lead to heart failure due to lack of blood hence always practice three minutes which are   when waking from sleep lie in bed for the first minute   sit in bed for the next minute   lower your legs sitting on the edge of the bed for the last minute after three minutes you will not have an anaemic brain and heart will not fail reducing the possibility of fall or sudden death share with family friends loved ones it can occur regardless of age young or old sharing is caring if you already

lower limbs spreads to the arms neck and other areas eventually increasing difficulty in breathing due to respiratory muscle dysfunction requires ventilation support and cardiac dysfunction can lead to heart failure the condition is universally fatal and death usually occurs before the age of   about eteplirsen eteplirsen is designed to address the underlying cause of dmd by restoring the

       " 'washington dc april     because sequenced care plans called clinical pathways now shape the treatment decisions for an increasing number of cancer patients an initiative called project innovation unveiled decoding clinical pathways the first online resource for the public that explains what pathways are and how they affect cancer care today the goal is to help patients understand factors that are shaping their care and if theirs is governed by pathway so they are better prepared to weigh available treatment options with their physician and care team project innovation is campaign to elevate advancements in cancer treatments as national priority coinciding with the publication of the policy paper recommendations for the role of clinical pathways in an era of personalized medicine on april     in the american journal of managed care the new module comes at time when the use of pathways is expanding and evolving authored by cancer specialists working with the national patient advocate foundation npaf the paper reports that many hospitals and physician practices now use pathways to translate published medical practice guidelines into the essential steps for treating specific disease or condition when properly designed and implemented these pathways help steer patients and providers to evidence based treatment options that take into account such factors as efficacy and safety along with cost however the npaf paper cautions that pathways can also be oriented more towards cookie cutter approaches that can preempt shared decision making between doctors and patients and interfere with physicians clinical judgement this is of increasing concern as insurance companies implement their own care plans as way to control costs and in some cases pay bonuses to doctors for prescribing on pathway treatments the american society of clinical oncology asco estimates that   individual health plans are currently implementing oncology pathways particularly for breast lung and colorectal cancers responding to these developments the online guide introduces the concept of pathways to patients and caregivers most of whom have never heard the term before and serves as primer on the purpose of these care plans the likely benefits of patient focused pathways and the potential limits restrictive versions may impose on available treatment options and patient access to emerging personalized therapies the decoding clinical pathways module is available on the project innovation website at www projectinnovation org for too long the discussion about cancer clinical pathways has been limited to physicians insurance companies and policymakers even though patients are directly affected by how these care plans are designed and what they cover said alan balch phd chief executive officer of the patient advocate foundation paf which manages project innovation our goal is to equip patients and caregivers with user friendly information about pathways so they will know what questions to ask and be prepared to weigh treatment options with their oncologist the need for transparency today clinical pathways are used to manage cancer and other challenging diseases such as congestive heart failure and diabetes when applied to cancer care these protocols are intended to allow oncologists and patients to weigh treatment regimens based on different safety and effectiveness profiles improve outcomes and drive value in the health system conversely some pathways erode the doctor patient relationship and the overall quality of cancer care by limiting or precluding treatment options that may be appropriately personalized to an individual patient which is why the npaf policy paper states patients need to be aware not just of how options on pathways were chosen but also of what other alternatives are viable according to guidelines that may not be listed in the pathway patients can then have an honest consultation with their physician about the various risks benefits and costs associated with each viable option reflecting this position asco published policy statement with nine recommendations to improve clinical pathways and the national patient advocate foundation issued set of guidelines for clinical pathway design and development calling for all clinical pathways to support shared decision making and reflect patients preferences for how to individualize their care however until these recommendations are enacted the online module encourages patients to take action themselves by asking these questions of their oncologist is my treatment determined by clinical pathway if so what treatment options are available through the pathway for my diagnosis and why were they chosen does the pathway include the option of enrolling in clinical trial what happens if the most appropriate treatment is not covered by the pathway are there ways that the health plan will cover this treatment does the insurance plan give financial incentives to the oncology practice for following the pathway further the online module recommends patients and caregivers take advantage of new rules under the affordable care act aca which require insurance companies to make available in concise easy to understand language what their health plans cover ways to get information on the drugs covered through the health plan are to visit the insurer website to review the list of prescriptions the plan includes ask the insurance company to provide the summary of benefits and coverage form that summarizes the key features of the plan such as the covered benefits cost sharing provisions and coverage limitations and exceptions call the insurance company directly to find out what drugs are covered about

       " 'another step towards finding best treatment combo for each individual patient eurekalert science newsa service of the american association for the advancement of science public release   feb   single dose of trastuzumab kick starts immune response in certain breast cancers case western reserve university tumor immune response to single dose of the her  inhibitor trastuzumab predicted which patients with her  positive breast cancer would respond to the drug on more long term basis according to the results of study published recently in clinical cancer research in addition vinay varadan phd assistant professor at case western reserve university school of medicine and member of the case comprehensive cancer center and his colleagues found that women with the her  enriched subtype of her  positive breast cancer subtype that is estrogen and progesterone receptor negative had the highest rate of immune response to treatment with trastuzumab with significant increases in immune response after single dose of the drug our study showed for the first time that the immune cell activating properties of trastuzumab are likely related to the subtypes of breast cancer varadan said knowing this can inform future trials studying the usefulness of adding immunotherapy drugs to trastuzumab only one half of women with her  positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab will have their tumor completely respond to therapy prior to undergoing surgery to remove the mass even when second her  targeting drug such as pertuzumab is combined with trastuzumab only   of women have complete response therefore there is need to find ways to identify women who are the most likely to respond to this presurgical treatment prior research showed that patient own immune system can play role in determining whether the tumor will respond to therapy with trastuzumab to look into this association further varadan and his colleagues used data from two clinical trials to measure the molecular makeup of breast tumors after treatment with single dose of trastuzumab they examined how and if the immune system interacted with the drug and if the immune associated properties of trastuzumab were related to the subtype of her  positive breast cancer women with the her  enriched subtype of disease had the highest rate of tumor response compared with other disease subtypes in patients taken from both clinical trials based on these results varadan and colleagues used molecular signature immune index to measure the amount of immune activity occurring within the tumor tissue again the her  enriched subtype tumors had significant increases in immune activity after only one dose of trastuzumab compared with the other subtypes we found that higher immune index evaluated after just one dose of trastuzumab predicted the tumor response varadan said this response seems to be specific to trastuzumab there was no association between immune activity and the subtype of breast cancer in patients who were given single dose of another chemotherapy also the predictive ability of the immune index test was not observed in patient tumors before any therapy was given suggesting that just single dose exposure may be beneficial way to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from trastuzumab based chemotherapy and thus do not need additional anti her  treatment varadan said finally the researchers wanted to identify which types of immune cells were associated with this brief exposure to trastuzumab they found that signatures of cell activity key immune response were consistently predictive of response after one dose of trastuzumab suggesting that the immune system is likely playing key role in enabling the therapeutic benefits of trastuzumab specifically pd   expression marker of cells was significantly increased in women with the her  enriched subtype of disease this suggests that this subtype of breast cancer may benefit most from the addition of drugs that target pd   given that the subtypes of her  positive disease and the immune signatures predict response to trastuzumab based therapy the next question is whether these signatures can also predict response to dual her  targeted therapyvaradan said additionally we would like to understand why certain breast cancers have strong immune response when treated with anti her  therapy while others escape immune surveillance we are poised to answer these questions using both lab based research as well as an ongoing preoperative clinical trial case  being conducted here

       " 'if you ve ever tried to lose weight you ve probably heard lot about water and weight loss can drinking more water really help you lose weight the short answer is yes and no if you re already well hydrated and getting plenty of water getting more water into your diet probably won make lot of difference but if you re going through your days little or lot dehydrated as many people are getting enough water could help dr christopher calapai o is manhattan osteopathic physician board certified in family medicine and anti aging medicine he states that there is always the case of too much of good thing some people are such water drinking devotees that they are aquaholics resulting in overhydration as result experts now fear we ve become so focused on staying hydrated that we re guzzling water to life threatening extremes dr calapai points out that there are two types of overhydration increased water intake and retaining water increased water intake or drinking more water than the kidneys can get rid of in the urine can cause too much water to collect in the body when the body is unable to get rid of excess water it is said to be retaining water this happens with several medical conditions for instance it can be dangerous because it throws off the balance between water and sodium in the blood overhydration caused by drinking too much water can occur both consciously and unconsciously dr calapai says that person may drink too much water during exercise some medications can also cause dry mouth and cause an increase in thirst increased thirst can also be caused by uncontrolled diabetes psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia primary polydipsia or psychogenic polydipsia can also cause compulsive water drinking what are the symptoms of overhydration symptoms of overhydration may not be recognized in the early stages but can include nausea and vomiting headache changes in mental state confusion or disorientation if left untreated overhydration can lead to dangerously low levels of sodium in the blood hyponatremia this can cause more severe symptoms such as muscle weakness spasms or cramps seizures unconsciousness coma how can overhydration be prevented endurance athletes can reduce the risk of overhydration by weighing themselves before and after race to determine how much water they have lost and need to replenish dr calapai emphasizes that individuals should avoid drinking more than one liter per hour of fluid drinking more fluids before and during race or anintensive athletic exertion can also help you avoid the need to drink too much water afterwards sports beverages that contain the electrolytes sodium and potassium are also recommended as both are lost in sweat so how do you know how much water you need for starters don rely solely on thirst says calapai as soon as you put water on your tongue you kill your thirst mechanism instead he suggests the following weigh yourself daily for week to check hydration your body weight shouldn fluctuate too much calapai says notice how much you pee and its color in the morning it should be copious amount and pale or clear aim to wake feeling hydrated if you re thirsty when you get out of bed in the morning you may not be consuming enough fluids when choosing sports drinks search for labels with low sugar dr calapai recommends about   grams per   ounce serving even natural drinks like coconut water have too much sugar and potassium to hydrate coffee tea and watery fruits and vegetables count toward fluid intake also caffeine is not diuretic dr calapai says it about volume so if you drink five cups you ll pee more start slowly sleep is six to eight hour fast so if you drink three cups of juice or water right away you ll trigger the volume response sip instead if you have an underlying medical condition such as diabetes congestive heart failure or kidney problems talk to your doctor about the best treatments for those conditions if you experience excessive thirst or an overly strong urge to drink water contact your doctor before you develop symptoms it could indicate medical problem that requires treatment dr christopher calapai o

have taken place over the past   years have been nothing short of phenomenal when reflect on the things have experienced not only in my professional career but the technological advances have seen over the course of my life across the board in all facets of life the effect is staggering from safety oriented upgrades we now take for granted like lap seatbelts and cars equipped with airbags to the improbably yet amazingly real home monitoring system that notifies me whenever there is anything out of the norm from climate control to movement at the front door think about it who would have ever guessed this would be the type of environment we would live in today technology has also been advancing in the healthcare industry suppose someone very close to you just had major health event and has been admitted to the hospital as health information management professionals that are in the business so to speak it could be said we are at slight advantage to know that being admitted to the hospital may not result always in the best outcome and are on the lookout for potential issues whether we like to think it or not we know what can and sometimes does happen for those who are not as informed an incredible amount of trust and faith is given to those who are now caring for your loved one when think about those who are not familiar with healthcare get concerned because many times they do not have an advocate that is independent of those caregivers take for example someone diagnosed with atrial fibrillation which not only presents itself as more enlarged heart on scan but also is somewhat of an irregular heartbeat when this person presents in the emergency room if there is no one there as an advocate for this person this person might receive medications because their blood pressure is not normal these medications then cause the patient to hallucinate which then might cause misdiagnosis by the caregivers who are unfamiliar with this person patient best defense is many times loved one who remains diligent and passionate asking questions each step of the way on the journey through the hospitalization what may be normal for your loved one is not normal for someone else so how can our health information actually save life how many times have you entered in your demographics in triplicate during the same episode of care for the same facility we document our medications we document our date of birth we document our health history we document our allergies we document our past surgeries we document our known problems but who really reads it to the caregiver it just data but to me or my loved one it my health story one that am passionate about one that want to protect not every patient is going to have an advocate available to them at all times while in the hospital for those who do they are lucky there have been many times having that loved one in the room with you might have saved your life perhaps they questioned medicine or questioned why certain procedure was necessary one of the challenges today patients face is the general lack of continuity of care limited knowledge of the patient history or the robotic response to automated and or scheduled orders without consideration of the current conditions having an advocate present is sometimes nothing short of being lifesaver the ability to provide such an ardent advocate for each patient is not currently possible or feasible but what if it was new smart phone application developed by larry trach at emrconnect is currently being tested that will provide giant step forward in helping patient safely navigate hospital stay this application will monitor data streams from the hospital electronic health record from three different subject areas registration and admit discharge transfer adt messages provider access of your patient record clinical results like labs vital signs and other pertinent documentation registration and adt monitoring after registration is completed you will be able to visually verify your demographic information guarantor and emergency contacts insurance information advance directive and providers assigned to your case registration system is susceptible to human and interface errors such as registration overlays bad medical record or account combines and system interface errors if any of your key demographics change during the course of your stay you would be immediately alerted monitoring provider access not all damage or injury is result of medical malpractice inappropriate access to your health information by someone who is not on your care team can be signal for identify theft loss of confidentiality and more you will be able to see all the providers that accessed your record what their role was and what they did on your behalf if you question particular activity or access review request can be sent directly to the designated privacy officer or security team clinical monitoring for predicting harmful conditions vital signs and labs can be good predictors of vital stress over sedation early detection of sepsis and many other conditions or adverse events each time new result arrives it will be reviewed scored and combined with other key measures risk factors and co morbidities because of the dynamic and sometimes chaotic nature of activities on the nursing unit it is easy to miss key piece of new information such as critical lab value not to mention the latencies between time of care and time of documentation the monitoring application would allow patient or the patient designee to receive messages about their healthcare there would be remote access for monitoring and message capability thus improving communication among all of the appropriate caregivers if we can wire our homes to provide us with up to the minute information in the interest of safety and security then we should certainly be able to apply this same technology to healthcare after all there is nothing more important than saving life

currently limited to body cooling and supportive measures experienced an incremental therapeutic benefit over patients receiving soc only said scott tarriff president and chief executive officer of eagle pharmaceuticals we believe that ryanodex has the potential to provide benefit to patients experiencing pathological thermal dysregulation associated with the use of ecstasy and methamphetamine stated adrian hepner executive vice president and chief medical officer we anticipate that having positive outcomes from our preclinical studies would enable us to meet with fda and potentially lead to rapid transition into pivotal clinical trials clinical studies in emergency settings are of relatively short duration due to the nature of the disorder and the known distribution of cases of ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication commonly associated with large holiday celebrations the development of ryanodex for body and brain hyperthermia associated with intoxication from illicit psychostimulant drugs in preclinical model in collaboration with nida experts will be an important step forward in addressing the serious consequences of this condition added hepner brain hyperthermia is one of the leading causes of severe morbidity and death in mdma ecstasy and methamphetamine intoxication in   the last year for which data is available     emergency room visits were related to ecstasy and methamphetamine use methamphetamines are the fourth most reported illicit drug in emergency room visits following cocaine marijuana and heroin and according to the drug abuse warning

methamphetamine also known as meth crystal chalk and ice is an extremely addictive stimulant drug that is chemically similar to amphetamine it takes the form of white odorless bitter tasting crystalline powder methamphetamine increases the amount of dopamine in the brain dopamine is involved in reward motivation the experience of pleasure and motor function methamphetamine ability to release dopamine rapidly in reward regions of the brain produces the euphoric rush or flash that many users experience repeated methamphetamine use can easily lead to addiction the consequences of methamphetamine abuse can cause memory loss aggression psychotic behavior damage to the cardiovascular system malnutrition and severe dental problems methamphetamine abuse has also been shown to contribute to increased transmission of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and hiv aids methamphetamine is classified as schedule ii drug available only through prescription that cannot be refilled

       " 'quote originally posted by mysticphd okay let test this what would your reaction be to the idea that the artificial constructs and operations in mathematics manipulating various measures of our reality can serve as abstract clues to the underlying composition of reality itself not just as predictive models of other measurable phenomena typically users of mathematics seldom consider the philosophical implications of the formulae as indices of the actual underlying composition of reality as an example of what am referring to the twin but distinct formulae mc   and hf have different uses and different units of measurement etc but they represent manifestation of the underlying unified field that comprises our reality the field manifestations we call energy mass momentum depending upon the application they are used and measured in are essentially equivalent as einstein revealed do you think we can draw any conclusions about the underlying composition of our reality from them quote originally posted by mitchellmckain my reaction is to tell you am not logical positivist whose program to divorce scientific language from metaphysical concepts was failure metaphysics the study of reality is not something conducted by scientific methodology and is therefore not science by the modern definition however science cannot be isolated from the metaphysical and epistemological foundations upon which it was derived this only goes to say that science does not and cannot hold itself up by its own bootstraps not that either of these philosophical endeavors share in the accepted epistemological superiority of science nevertheless science requires such philosophical groundwork and generally relegates such efforts to creative interlude given names like scientific visualization understand your clarification of your position it is encouraging quote guess am straying little from your question so perhaps more to the point should say this while science is defined by very restrictive methodology philosophy is much less restrictive and religion has no general defined methodology at all the result is not only considerably more diversity of opinion in philosophy and religion but also while religion and philosophy for the most part as well cannot inform science the opposite is not the case science certainly can and does inform both philosophy and religion guess in summation am saying yes to your question it can but this does not impart scientific status to these philosophical and religious conclusions good we agree quote don know why you claim such thing this has certainly never applied to me and it seems to me that scientists do this quite frequently what is true is that they know the difference between such speculations and proper science perhaps it was more strongly worded than intended my experience is they typically know the difference but have no interest or desire to even engage the speculations seeing no practical relevance in them although many simply see the artificial constructs as models of quantitative representations of processes and phenomena not as indicators of any underlying composition of reality quote of course do mean this is something that do but while many might see unified field as the underlying reality think the evidence is greater for underlying reality to be something more of geometrical nature for example   general relativity pretty much reduces gravitational fields to the geometry of space time   kaluza and klein showed that this can include electromagnetism by simply extending gr to   dimensions   string theory theory reduces all the different particles e fields to the vibrational modes strings and higher dimensional branes the geometry of spacetime is fraught with complications that arise from the very nature of our thoughts and the quantum formation time that underpins our delayed experience of our instantaneous awareness that creates the phenomena of spacetime we can touch on that later it is true that multidimensional speculations provide the advantage of increasing degrees of freedom to represent reality but am lover of four dimensional world or as minkowski called it die vierdimenionsale velt once we start speculating beyond those dimensions almost anything can be represented string theory has the vibratory nature of reality down but they create virtual impossibility to ever empirically test their formulations we can only really measure in four dimensions quote of course there is always the possibility that what we have is two complementary representations of the same thing this often implies that reality is other than what we visualize and the closest we can get is two different images which only partially capture the reality of the thing you know like how photons electrons and such are both particles and waves at the same time yes they are complementary representations that reveal that our underlying reality is actually nothing more than vibratory manifestations of field this along with quantum mechanics seems to suggest that particles are simply events we measure and not actual material substance existing through time this has unsettling implications for our macro experiences as well it would seem even we are merely vibratory events existing as some manner of aggregate spherical standing waveforms whose permanence is illusory am pleased that we do seem to be on similar wavelength to egregiously punish pun quote s mc   and hf do not in of themselves have different units but any equation can used in different units if you so choose the dimensions remain the same but the units or measuring yardsticks you use is arbitrary and can thus be altered agree but that is ancillary to the point wanted to make using them as indices of the composition of our reality ',\n",

       " 'every time we pray the lord prayer most of us say forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us this however is not what matthew     actually says there we read forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors in matthew       jesus explains that if we forgive the trespasses of others ours will be forgiven but if we do not forgive the trespasses of others then ours will not be forgiven in luke the word used is sins as jesus probably did not speak in greek all of the new testament is translation of the aramaic which he would have spoken and in jewish thought of his time debts trespasses and sins were interchangeable concepts their meaning would overlap think that english does provide us some interesting depth though today mp gospel is from section on forgiveness in mt       it begins with how to confront those who have sinned and then goes on to say that when two or three gather in jesus name he is with them for many christians this is very uncomfortable word from the lord because he says that the church humans are an extension of god in other words there is no simple division between god and man as is so popular among many jesus says in other places as well that when we are in him our words and actions carry the divine imprimatur and convey the power and authority of god jesus takes the church very very seriously our reading today begins in verse   where peter asks how many times must we forgive seven times this is biblical number and conveys the idea of generous mercy however jesus ups the ante considerably the greek can be translated as seventy times seven   or seventy seven   there is probably reference here to genesis     if cain is avenged seven fold truly lamech seventy seven fold and makes clear that we as jesus people are in the mercy and forgiveness business the lord then illustrates the principle with parable man is in debt owing ten thousand talents one talent is about six to ten thousand denarii denarii is day wage so it is at least six thousand days wages or about seventeen years wages multiply that by ten thousand and you have many many lifetimes of debt it is totally unpayable the equivalent of billion dollars for us so the man is to be sold into slavery and his family as well however after begging for mercy and making the ridiculous promise to pay it back if given time the man receives gracious kindness and the master writes off the debt then the same man bumps into someone who owes him one hundred days wages just over three months however he ignores the pleas for mercy and imprisons his debtor in the end other servants distressed by his cruelty go to the master and inform him of this turn of events so the master confronts the man and points out the mercy which he received the lack of mercy he demonstrated and the punishment he receives what he gave the other prison in english the words sin and trespasses are negative they refer to an act which transgresses debt on the other hand has broader meaning debt is something owed sin focused western christians can be so sin aware that we are at risk to overlook the blessings for which we are also indebted to god we also have an unpayable debt of gratitude too often people view their minor sins as unworthy of death sentence even if god is perfect it does not resonate that he cannot bear to be in the presence of flawed humanity perhaps if that is how you think it is easier to imagine god problem with people who are so far in debt for blessings as well as sins not being grateful and graceful to others let ponder every breath is gift hundreds of gifts each hour day after day if you don believe it ask someone with copd or asthma or lung disease every breath gift debt each heart beat is gift sending life sustaining blood throughout our bodies hundreds of heart beats day day after day if you don believe ask someone unable to walk because of congestive heart failure or other heart disease every beat of your heart gift debt is seeing blessing yes the debt of eyesight is hearing blessing yes every sound blessing debt is beauty around you blessing yes and each beautiful thing blessing debt what of love acceptance laughter companionship every act of kindness we receive any good thing which enriches us each moment and every blessing another debt food and drink rest and sleep painless moments and pleasures each one every second it lasts blessing wonderful gift and another debt even if were sinless and could stand before god in righteousness my debt would remain unpayable because all that am and all that have is gift existence is gift thinking and feeling and being all gifts what is my debt millions of heart beats and breaths thousands of sunlit days and gentle breezes glorious rains and sparkling stars hundreds of loved ones to share my life journey memories of days gone by good days and ask those whose memories are gone what blessing memory is more debts yes owe god billions and billions many blessings blessings take for granted blessings which assume should have everything have owe to god all things and he writes it all off every debt every good thing he has done and every bad thing have done written off except says jesus except as we pray except unforgiveness except the refusal to give mercy as we receive it except the rejection of his life in us the one debt that must be paid by us is treating others with love and mercy unforgiveness cancels his gracious mercy so says jesus we are all debtors debtors beyond imagining treat others debtors as god the father has

affected to drop dead during their normal activities it is essential that you be aware of the symptoms of sudden heart attack today modern treatment is very effective the sooner this is started the greater are the chances of complete recovery the symptoms of heart attack are well established the underlying causes of heart disease have been well documented and the ways of reducing heart attack are clear cut and well established much research has given many answers sensible people will follow the straightforward recommendations offered these are set out at the end of this section it is essential to recognize and provide emergency first aid treatment for possible heart attack heart attack symptoms here are the key heart attack symptoms as set out by the national heart foundation prolonged oppressive pain or unusual discomfort in the centre of the chest behind the breastbone the pain may radiate to the shoulder arm neck or jaw often the pain or discomfort is accompanied by sweating nausea vomiting and shortness of breath may occur sometimes the symptoms subside then recur never forget chest pain that does not go away after     minutes of rest should never be ignored it could be heart attack what to do in the case of heart attack take immediate action make patient comfortable if conscious sit the person up allay anxiety speak encouraging words call ambulance if possible suggest it may be heart attack and special coronary care ambulance may be available if patient collapses breathing stops or heart stops expired air resuscitation and external cardiac compression must be started if no assistance is available get the patient to the nearest hospital as urgently as possible time may mean life saved the quicker the patient receives expert attention the more likely are the chances of survival and complete recovery they reduce with the passage of time and no help do not be embarrassed about seeking help it is better to be wrong than make an error of judgment keep calm do not panic life could depend on your prompt efficient calm manner the symptoms of an infarction are extremely variable according to the size of the infarct some are major and can produce sudden death but the majority are smaller and produce varying range of symptoms attacks are not necessarily related to exercise as angina is indeed attacks may come on while at rest or even during sleep however usually symptoms and signs are fairly typical and allow doctor to make prompt diagnosis indeed person affected can often form an accurate diagnosis an important rule of thumb is that it is better to inaccurately self diagnose heart attack than miss it early diagnosis and prompt treatment may be lifesaving no age group is immune from cardiac infarcts however they are far more common in males aged     years males outnumber females by   to   it seems that increasing numbers of younger males are being afflicted with coronaries this may be related to the added stresses of modern living although others deny this the high level of living with an increase in fat content of food there is greater cholesterol intake and other factors in recent years the importance of smoking as cause of heart disease has become recognized it is now well documented as leading cause of this disability although the heart may have suffered relatively minor muscle damage the chances of severe and usually fatal change in heart rhythm are about   times greater during the first four hours than during the next   many heart attack patients believe they have indigestion colic dyspepsia or some other trivial stomach upset many feel embarrassed to make fuss or summon assistance fearing they are wrong in their beliefs others deliberately neglect to call help fearing the worst but hoping their inner fears may be wrong each year more than   americans die from heart attacks and diseases of the cardiovascular system e heart and blood vessel systems prompt expert treatment can radically reduce disastrous outcome indeed it is believed that with proper attention   per cent of heart attack patients recover and can return to near normal life again heart attack treatment heart attack is medical emergency if person has any of the symptoms enumerated it is imperative to obtain immediate expert medical assistance there is no place for home remedies in these cases apart from allaying the anxiety of the patient and making him or her feel more comfortable taking an aspirin can help while awaiting this attention if sudden collapse occurs and the heart stops beating expired air resuscitation and external cardiac compression will help maintain breathing and circulation if you have had some basic training in this field it is worth commencing and may be lifesaving call an ambulance at once and

cardiac emergencies and equipped with highly trained teams called paramedic units are now available in most capital cities in australia and new zealand they can often be at the patient side within few minutes and so can initiate lifesaving treatment within only few moments immediately emergency care has been administered the patient is then transported to the special coronary care ward or intensive care unit of major hospital here highly skilled and very specialized treatment with constant supervision is available the patient is usually attached to constant electrocardiograph machine and screen reveals continuous picture of the heart action the relevant tests that are needed are carried out quickly treatment is maintained at high level of efficiency prompt and accurate diagnosis is made

heart attack subsequent serial tests indicate the progress of the patient death from coronary is usually due to the failure of the heart to continue pumping adequately or to breakdown in the nervous control of the heart which leads to serious condition called ventricular fibrillation newer drugs that assist in bringing this condition back to normal are now being used the drug lignocaine xylocaine assists in reinstating normal heartbeat large family of medications called the beta blockers can also assist in gross heartbeat irregularities machine called defibrillator can also help re establish normal heartbeat activity pain relieving preparations such as morphine oxygen sedation and the medications that have stood the test of time are still widely used for infarcts reassurances and supportive measures are as important today as in earlier days when facilities for emergency treatment were far less sophisticated than they are now act promptly studies have shown that it takes the average heart attack victim three hours to do anything about his symptoms the average time lapse between the onset of warning symptoms and hospital admission is eight hours the first four hours are of paramount importance the earlier heart attack patient can be admitted to hospital and get expert attention the greater are the chances of survival there are many general measures that the anginal patient can carry out and which may effectively assist in keeping symptoms at minimum level avoiding the known precipitating factors will help immeasurably the patient should make an effort to avoid undue exercise that is known to produce symptoms similarly social and environmental predisposing factors must be avoided it is best to avoid circumstances where emotional crises and flaring tempers are involved for this will only breed more and greater problems if allowed to persist it would be best if the patient could adopt philosophical attitude to life in general accept the position and make the most of the remaining years of life meals of moderate size and easily digestible food preferably low fat in content and free from fried foods are best if there is obvious overweight sticking to

       " 'a diagram showing how stem cell in bone marrow becomes different types of blood cells click for credit in   speech john kerry complained about the bush administration saying nothing illustrates this administration anti science attitude better than george bush cynical decision to limit research on embryonic stem cells during the heat of the stem cell wars this was common refrain life saving treatments could be produced with embryonic stem cells and anyone who questioned whether or not it was morally acceptable to destroy one life in order to experiment with saving another was anti science never mind that there are stem cells in everyone body commonly called adult stem cells and those stem cells also have the potential to cure illnesses everyone knew that using embryonic stem cells would be better what the difference between embryonic stem cells and adult stems cells well most of the cells in your body have specific tasks your skin cells perform one set of tasks while your muscle cells perform another set of tasks your liver cells another set of tasks etc etc these cells have all specialized so they can perform their tasks efficiently stem cell by contrast is cell that hasn yet specialized it can develop into many different cells depending on your body needs embryonic stem cells end up developing into all the cells that make up the body so they are thought to be very very flexible when it comes to what they can develop into however to get those stem cells you have to kill the embryo adult stem cells on the other hand have already specialized to some degree for example the drawing at the top of this post shows how an adult stem cell found in bone marrow can develop into various different blood cells while that shows some serious flexibility bone marrow stem cells don normally develop into wildly different cells like skin cells as result it is thought that adult stem cells aren as flexible as embryonic stem cells on the positive side however you don have to kill anything to get adult stem cells the scientific question then boils down to this is it worth working with stem cells that might not be as flexible as embryonic stem cells in order to avoid killing human embryos those who answered that question with yes have been routinely labelled anti science however now that we are   years past mr kerry speech we can see that adult stem cells have in fact demonstrated success in treating wide variety of illnesses obviously lot more research has to be done and none of these treatments are standard or routine yet nevertheless it is now clear that if there is limit to the abilities of adult stem cells when it comes to treating illnesses we haven reached it yet that brings me to the reason am writing this article over the past few days have seen two more examples of adult stem cells successfully treating illnesses the first example appears in jama neurology specialized publication of the journal of the american medical association this study dealt with the treatment of myasthenia gravis degenerative neuromuscular disorder that can be life threatening the authors of the study followed   patients that were treated with stem cells from their own bone marrow and all of them achieved stable remission and were freed from ongoing myasthenia gravis therapy   now of course this is small study and while some patients were followed for   years others were followed for only     years in addition the authors note that specialized patient care is necessary for this treatment to be effective as result they only recommend it for institutions that have experience treating patients with myasthenia gravis nevertheless it at least shows the potential of using patient own adult stem cells to treat neuromuscular disorder the other study isn as groundbreaking but it does provide new insights into the use of adult stem cells to treat heart failure the authors reported on randomized double blind placebo controlled study of end stage patients with serious heart failure the only hope such patients have is for heart transplant since that wasn possible for these patients they agreed to be part of study that examined the efficacy of treating their heart failure with once again stem cells from their own bone marrow the procedure typically took only two hours and most patients were released from the hospital the day after the procedure was done after   months those who received the treatment were   less likely to have been taken to hospital and   less likely to die than those who received placebo   while those numbers aren as wonderful as the numbers in the myasthenia gravis study they are significant in addition the study was the largest ever done on this kind of treatment thus it clearly shows that patients who need heart transplant have at least one other option thanks to adult stem cells far from being anti science then caution about using embryonic stem cells is scientifically reasonable adult stem cells have shown quite lot of promise and they avoid the moral problems associated with killing embryos references   adam bryant et al myasthenia gravis treated with autologous

california generally speaking insurers only cover the costs of the new drugs for patients with extremely high cholesterol caused by genetic disorders or those with history of heart problems and elevated cholesterol the insurance paperwork can run several pages and often requires detailed history of past treatments caught in the middle of the coverage fight are patients who say they desperately need more options to control bad cholesterol or ldl christian jacobs   takes eight medications to manage his cholesterol and related complications including blood thinners for the seven artery opening stents he received since   he has rare form of inheritable cholesterol that occurs in roughly one in million people so he was shocked when his insurance provider unitedhealth rejected his doctors prescription for repatha was floored he said how in the world can we be rejected for medication that meet every single standard for jacobs said unitedhealth recommended he continue his current drug regimen to see if it lowers his cholesterol he is appealing the decision unitedhealth which declined to comment on jacobs situation due to patient privacy laws said in statement it uses clinical guidelines and scientific evidence when making coverage decisions these new therapies offer additional ldl cholesterol lowering and outcomes studies are still pending said the firm recent medical history is littered with once promising drugs that lowered test results like cholesterol yet failed to actually help patients considering the high prices and limited data many doctors favor go slow approach if you re going to spend that kind of money on medication then you need to know that it really doing something said dr hal chadow of brookdale university hospital chadow has successfully prescribed the drugs to several high risk patients but he wants to see more research before using them more broadly some of the nation top cardiologists predict the drugs will eventually reduce heart attack rates far below levels currently seen with statin pills the standard of care for high cholesterol since the  s but studies confirming those benefits are still months away key reason insurers demand extensive documentation before reimbursing the drugs really think it a disservice to the public health to put people in charge of this who are essentially bean counters said dr steven nissen of the cleveland clinic the medical center has assigned an expert to coach doctors on completing the insurance paperwork industry figures suggest high bar   percent of claims for repatha and praluent were initially rejected in the last quarter of   according symphony health firm that analyzes insurance data the companies doing the rejecting say they are merely following prescribing instructions on the medicines which are approved by the food and drug administration dr steve miller of express scripts the largest pharmacy benefit manager says the company is approving more claims as doctors get better at picking the right patients and making sure they have adequate supporting data wall street continues to bet that the drugs known as pcsk  inhibitors will become blockbusters eventually while many have slashed short term estimates most analysts predict that repatha and praluent will generate combined annual sales of over   billion by   according to polling by evaluate pharma drugs that generate   billion or more annually are considered blockbusters the analyst projections depend on one key assumption that follow up studies show the drugs reduce heart attacks and death amgen is expected to unveil data from its pivotal study later this year with similar study from sanofi next year but even assuming those studies pan out some experts say the drugs which are self injected once or twice month depending on the medication and indication are still overpriced one analysis concluded that pcsk  drugs represent low value for patients and said fairer price would be roughly half the list price or between     and     per year according to the institute for clinical and economic review sanofi and amgen each criticized the group analysis disagreeing with its methods and conclusions

performance he points to another pricey drug launched last summer novartis heart failure drug entresto has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and death more than older drugs but its     annual price has slowed uptake novartis has signed unusual pay for performance contracts with several insurers offering partial refunds if the drug fails to deliver better outcomes pearson group gave the drug positive marks in an evaluation last year we came out saying good evidence on clinical effectiveness and good value in november amgen announced similar agreement with harvard pilgrim health care system if repatha doesn lower patients cholesterol to levels seen in company trials harvard pilgrim gets rebate that approach is already used in europe and could become more common here think payers

       " 'source by dr mercola have you checked your vitamin status lately ideally you want to maintain vitamin level of   to   ng ml year round based on mounting research   ng ml appears to be the magic number at which whole host of health benefits are reaped vitamin deficiency has been linked to variety of illnesses   including heart disease stroke hypertension autoimmune diseases type   and type   diabetes rheumatoid arthritis crohn disease multiple sclerosis cognitive decline alzheimer disease infectious diseases and several deadly cancers this includes cancers of the breast colon prostate ovaries esophagus lymphatic system and even melanoma vitamin lowers overall mortality risk it no surprise then that the institute of medicine iom reports an association between vitamin and overall mortality risk   in one   month long study  involving more than     healthy adults those who were most deficient in vitamin had an   percent increased risk of death from any cause this is the kind of benefit m talking about when say it would be wise to temper fears of melanoma the deadliest form of skin cancer and weigh that risk against other benefits such as significantly reduced risk of death from any disease moreover by adhering to sensible sun exposure guidelines and making sure you do not get burned you can maximize your benefits and minimize the risks of skin damage that could lead to skin cancer on the whole overexposure not avoiding all sun exposure is the real problem when it comes to raising your risk for skin cancer   please read this important ftc article in highly controversial action last week the ftc had me stop selling our uv light systems which they classified as tanning beds but was providing as far more effective option for vitamin to the hundreds of millions of people who don have access to enough sunshine the legal battles with the ftc lasted few years and required me to travel to washington dc to meet with the ftc attorneys to work through these issues finally chose the lesser of all the evil options that were available to me if you have not yet read my detailed rebuttal to the ftc action against me please do so now and let me know what you think about this important health freedom threat really am interested in hearing what your thoughts are on this important issue your input on this means lot to me thanks for taking the time to respond higher vitamin lower cancer risk previous research found that vitamin level of   ng ml was associated with   percent lower risk of breast cancer   breast cancer patients with an average vitamin level of   ng ml were also twice as likely to survive compared to women with low levels average   ng ml   most recently researchers at university of california san diego school of medicine report that raising your serum   hydroxyvitamin   oh to  ng ml can slash your risk of all invasive cancers by   percent       according to study co author cedric garland dr h   we have quantitated the ability of adequate amounts of vitamin to prevent all types of invasive cancer combined which had been terra incognita until publication of this paper these findings support an inverse association between   oh and risk of cancer and highlight the importance for cancer prevention of achieving vitamin blood serum concentration above   ng ml the concentration recommended by the iom for bone health improving vitamin status is key cancer prevention tool by pooling data from two previous studies one randomized trial and one cohort study the former of which showed   percent lower cancer risk for women with vitamin level of   ng ml compared to baseline of   ng ml  they were able to get much larger sample size with broader range of vitamin levels this allowed them to more accurately determine the ideal vitamin level for cancer prevention the study included all invasive cancers with the exception of skin cancer and had follow up period of nearly four years as reported by science daily   in the lappe trial cohort the median blood serum level of   oh was   nanograms per milliliter in the grassrootshealth prospective cohort it was higher   ng ml the researchers found that the age adjusted cancer incidence was     cases per     person years in the lappe cohort and   per     person years in the grassrootshealth cohort cancer incidence declined with increased   oh women with   oh concentrations of   ng ml or greater had   percent lower risk of cancer than women with levels of   ng ml or less primary prevention of cancer rather than expanding early detection or improving treatment will be essential to reversing the current upward trend of cancer incidence worldwide the researchers wrote this analysis suggests that improving vitamin status is key prevention tool research needs to be translated into public health policy in creighton university press release co author robert heaney d highlighted the importance of sensible sun exposure for vitamin optimization and the need to modify public health policy with regards to sun exposure as noted in the press release   be sure you re getting as much vitamin as nature would give you under natural circumstances and you were wandering around outdoors exposing lot of skin in the summer heaney said he refers to study in which vitamin levels were analyzed for native tribes in east africa they received nearly     international units per day of vitamin and had lower cancer risk in   the institute of medicine recommended vitamin dosage of   international units per day that not enough says heaney but what is enough for heaney he believes people should first discover how much vitamin is in their blood levels this is your blood level right now you know how much you re taking if you want it higher increase your dose so then everybody is in control of their own vitamin nutritional status that way instead of having to be dependent on lab tests and physicians heaney said drawing on results from his study heaney believes vitamin needs to be widely discussed we have got to find way to translate these studies into public health policy heaney said at the end of january   president obama established the cancer moonshot task force with the aim of creating comprehensive plan to enable progress in treatment and care of cancer   optimizing vitamin is one of the foundational recommendations that really need to be part of that plan yet it not at least not yet how does vitamin help protect against cancer vitamin influences virtually every cell in your body and is absolutely crucial to radically reduce your risk of cancer your organs can convert the vitamin in your bloodstream into calcitriol which is the hormonal or activated version of vitamin your organs then use it to repair damage including that from cancer cells vitamin also triggers apoptosis cell death in cancer cells according to dr garland in nearly all forms of breast cancer vitamin affects the structure of your epithelial cells these cells are held together by glue like substance called cadherin which provides structure to the cell cadherin is made up of mostly vitamin and calcium if you don have adequate vitamin that structure comes apart and those cells do what they are programmed to do in order to survive they go forth and multiply if this cell proliferation gets out of control you may end up with cancer if you have breast cancer in progress the addition of vitamin can help stop cancer cells in their tracks by replenishing cadherin once cancer growth is slowed your immune system can begin to get ahead of the cancer cells because it doesn have to deal with such an overabundance of them it just disposing of the leftovers low vitamin predicts aggressive prostate cancer in related news researchers at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine recently discovered that men diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer have vitamin levels below   ng ml according to this study vitamin may actually be used as biomarker to predict the aggressiveness of prostate cancer as noted in university press release   the relationship between vitamin and prostate cancer may explain some disparities seen in prostate cancer especially among african american men prior research showed african american men who live in low sunlight locations are up to   times more likely to have vitamin deficiency than caucasian men but because vitamin is biomarker for bone health and aggressiveness of other diseases all men should check their levels lead investigator dr adam murphy said all men should be replenishing their vitamin to normal levels murphy said it smart preventive health care vitamin dramatically improves heart function yet another recent study found that vitamin has nothing short of amazing ability to improve heart function in those with chronic heart failure the five year long trial included   patients undergoing conventional treatment for chronic heart failure half of them were given vitamin d  supplement the other half received placebo in addition to their standard of care after one year the vitamin group experienced significant improvement in heart function compared to the placebo group as reported by the independent   dr klaus witte who led the research project told the independent the improvements seen in patients taking the vitamin were nothing short of amazing and called his team findings significant breakthrough researchers made ultrasound scans of participants hearts and measured the how much blood was being pumped with each heartbeat to get figure called ejection fraction the ejection fraction of healthy person is usually around   to   per cent but it dropped to an average of   per cent among the patients enrolled in the study for those who took vitamin d  the ejection fraction was improved from   to   per cent while the rest experienced not change for some patients this discovery means regularly taking vitamin d  could lessen the need for them to be fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator icd which can correct dangerous heart rhythms the researchers note that even though they used vitamin d  supplement in this study exposure to sunlight would likely produce the same results for the simple reason that it all about achieving higher vitamin serum level comparing our modern lifestyle to that of ancient humans who spent far more time outdoors the researchers link our current deficiency epidemic to chronic sun avoidance current advice to avoid sun exposure seriously endangers your health indeed dermatologists have severely compromised the public health by fighting an irrational and dangerous war against uv exposure be it from the sun or uv light devices disease statistics reveal the sun scare campaign has really been taken too far at present the s surgeon general     the american academy of dermatology aad and many other cancer organizations recommend complete and total sun avoidance in order to prevent skin cancer the aad will not even acknowledge different recommendations based on skin type even though it widely recognized that darker skinned individuals need far more uv exposure in order to produce vitamin in their skin adding insult to injury the s preventative task force suggests vitamin testing is unnecessary and both the institute of medicine iom and the american medical association ama recommend vitamin serum levels and vitamin intake levels that are far below ideal based on the evidence in the medical literature the iom recommends taking just   ius of vitamin a day up to age   but as pointed out in   paper   the iom underestimates the need by factor of   due to mathematical error this error has never been addressed moreover research  suggests it would require     iu of vitamin per day to get majority     percent of the population to reach  ng ml meanwhile the ama uses of  ng ml as sufficient but as shown in the featured study this level significantly increases your risk for cancer   ng ml is really the cutoff point for sufficiency in order to prevent wide range of diseases sun avoidance equals smoking in terms of mortality risk sun avoidance actually increases your risk of death very similar to that of smoking that was the conclusion of recent competing risk analysis by swedish researchers who found that while women with active sun exposure habits had higher risk of melanoma compared to sun avoiders they also had lower risk of mortality from far more deadly diseases than melanoma including cardiovascular disease according to the authors   nonsmokers who avoided sun exposure had life expectancy similar to smokers in the highest sun exposure group indicating that avoidance of sun exposure is risk factor for death of similar magnitude as smoking compared to the highest sun exposure group life expectancy of avoiders of sun exposure was reduced by         years when you look at the overall picture it clear to see that we are building the perfect storm for serious negative health outcomes due to vitamin deficiency the role of vitamin in disease prevention growing body of evidence shows that vitamin plays crucial role in disease prevention and maintaining optimal health there are about     genes in your body and vitamin affects nearly     of them as well as vitamin receptors located throughout your body according to one large scale study optimal vitamin levels can slash your risk of cancer by as much as   percent keeping your levels optimized can help prevent at least   different types of cancer including pancreatic lung ovarian prostate and skin cancers how vitamin performance testing can help optimize your health is it any wonder then that no matter what disease or condition is investigated vitamin appears to play crucial role this is why am so excited about the action project by grassrootshealth dr robert heaney is the research director of grassrootshealth and is part of the design of the action project as well as analysis of the research findings grassrootshealth shows how you can take action today on known science with consensus of experts without waiting for institutional lethargy

answer is simple they are the many illnesses the s government has admitted are associated with the exposure to agent orange hopefully with time our government will admit there are other diseases caused by their spraying of herbicides and defoliants than they originally admitted to some may ask what agent orange is and believe it or not more and younger people have never heard of that term even though it has caused illnesses or deaths of thousands of people what is interesting is was at doctor office not too long ago and medical assistant ask me what agent orange was when mentioned that it had caused most of my medical issues the term agent orange is derived from the combination of code names for herbicide orange ho and agent lnx agent orange was one of the herbicides and defoliants used by the s military as part of its chemical warfare program operation ranch hand during the vietnam conflict from   through   and besides that the   gallon drums the deadly toxins were shipped in had big orange strip around it thus where the name agent orange came from during the vietnam war the united states military sprayed millions of gallons of deadly material containing chemical herbicides and defoliants in vietnam eastern laos and parts of cambodia according to the worldwide web the program goal was to defoliate forested and rural land depriving guerrillas of cover and to induce forced draft urbanization destroying the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside and forcing them to flee to the s dominated cities thus depriving the guerrillas of their rural support and food supply many are unaware the s government also sprayed agent orange in korea many of the people exposed to agent orange and ll call them poor souls didn find out the true justification for their debilitating illnesses until later in life and some never found out what caused their illnesses before they died another interesting fact is some vietnam veterans who have had or now have diseases brought on by exposure to agent orange dioxin is not alone and many of their children are also infected by agent orange these children through birth are the second generation of people suffering from agent orange exposure and many wonder if there will there be third or fourth generation the s government has continued an attempt to downplay the effects of exposure to agent orange the red cross of vietnam estimates that up to one million vietnamese people are disabled or have health problems due to agent orange but the s government has dismissed these figures as unreliable and unrealistically high many americans are currently suffering or have died from the consequences of agent orange exposure without ever receiving medical care of monetary compensation conservative is estimates are that more than     million americans in addition to allied forces and the vietnamese people were exposed to the deadly brew of pesticides and defoliants guess m one of the more lucky ones who now receive medical care and monetary compensation from my illnesses due to my exposure to agent orange for information purposes served in vietnam during       and   just think left vietnam in   but the government didn admit my illnesses were not associated to agent orange until about   years later the money is great but the debilitating effects suffer from my exposure to agent orange continues and each day look healthier than really am have learned more about some of past illnesses and some from ones that are now surfacing here is my who who of illnesses have either suffered or currently now suffer heart attack and quadruple bypass operation yep was cracked open like walnut in   congestive heart failure ischemic heart disease type ii diabetes high blood pressure skin cancer neuropathy and they implanted pacemaker in me last year am also suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease better known as copd but the s government hasn yet admitted it is caused by my exposure to agent orange according to the department of veterans affairs an agent orange settlement fund was created by the resolution of the agent orange product liability litigation class action lawsuit brought by vietnam veterans and their families regarding injuries allegedly incurred as result of the exposure by vietnam veterans to chemical herbicides used during the vietnam conflict remember they never designated it as war the suit was brought against the major manufacturers of these herbicides the class action case was settled out of court in   for   million dollars reportedly the largest settlement of its kind at that time the settlement fund was distributed to class members in accordance with distribution plan established by united states district court judge jack weinstein who presided over the litigation and the settlement because the plaintiff class was so large an estimated   million people the fund was distributed to class members in the united states through two separate programs designed to provide maximum benefits to vietnam veterans and their families most in need of assistance payment program that provided cash compensation to totally disabled veterans and survivors of deceased veterans and class assistance program that provided funds for social services organizations and networks for the purpose of establishing and maintaining programs for the benefit of the class as whole applications for the payment program had to be submitted prior to december     and program operated over period of   years distributing total of   million in cash payments to members of the class action in the united states of the     claims received by the payment program approximately     vietnam veterans or their survivors received cash payments which averaged about     each not much for their suffering and or death on september     the district court ordered the fund closed its assets having been fully distributed another sad thing to come about was the supreme court put the preverbal skids on thousands of americans who faithfully served their county during the vietnam war and korea and who were exposed to the agent orange by making ruling in   the supreme court let stand lower court rulings that the companies were not responsible for the implications of military use of agent orange because the war materials were supplied at the direction of the s government that decision basically made it impossible for individuals exposed to agent orange to be able to sue dow chemical and monsanto south korea highest court upheld ruling during july   ordering two s agent orange makers to compensate   vietnam war veterans in one of the country most prominent lawsuits the supreme court recognized the epidemiological correlation between the toxic defoliant agent orange and skin diseases for the first time saying the   victims should receive total of   million won hk     million from dow chemical and monsanto it isn too late for those s military veterans and their families to receive medical care and financial aid the veterans administration continues to attempt to help those military personnel and their families suffering from various illnesses brought on by their exposure to deadly toxin but they can only do so much spouses and dependent children of living veterans also may be eligible for health care and other va benefits and surviving spouses dependent children and dependent parents of veterans who were exposed to agent orange or other herbicides during military service and died as the result of diseases related to the exposure may be eligible for survivors benefits if military veteran dependent of veteran or parent of veteran believes their illnesses was caused by exposure to agent orange they should contact their nearest veteran service officer fraternal veteran service organization or department of veterans affairs in order to learn more about applying for disability through the va ',\n",

       " 'posted mar     at    pm nano balls filled with poison wipe out metastatic cancer in mice for most cancer patients it not the original tumor that poses the greatest risk it the metastases that invade the lung liver and other tissues now researchers have come up with an approach that tricks these spinoff tumors into swallowing poison so far the strategy has only been tested in mice where it proved highly effective but the results are promising enough that the researchers are planning to launch clinical trials in cancer patients within year the new work is very innovative stuff says steven libutti geneticist and cancer surgeon at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york city who was not involved in the study the treatment he explains works in three steps to place conventional chemotherapeutic agent near the nucleus or nuclei of metastatic cancer cell where the drug molecules are most lethal it almost like multistage rocket that lifts astronauts off earth sends them to the moon and returns them safely he says at the heart of the new therapy is chemotherapeutic agent called doxorubicin dox the drug has been mainstay of cancer treatment for years as it jams up dna in the cell nucleus and prevents tumor cells from dividing but when it injected into the bloodstream the drug can also kill heart muscle cells and cause heart failure which often forces oncologists to either dial back the dose or discontinue it altogether delivering dox only to tumor cells is therefore highly desirable but it has been major challenge hoping to provide such cell specificity researchers led by mauro ferrari nanomedicine expert as well as president and ceo of the houston methodist research institute in texas have spent years developing porous silicon particles as drug carriers the particles micrometer scale size and disklike shape allows them travel unimpeded through normal blood vessels but when they hit blood vessels around tumors which are typically malformed and leaky the particles fall out of the circulation and pool near the tumor that was step one in delivering chemotherapeutic drugs to their target but just filling such particles with dox doesn do much good ferrari says even if small amount of the drug finds its way inside tumor cells those cells often have membrane proteins that act as tiny pumps to push the drug back outside the cell before it can do any damage silicon particles act as nanoparticle generators inpg that carry stringlike polymers loaded with chemotherapy compound called doxorubicin dox nature biotechnology to get large amounts of dox inside the metastatic tumor cells and then past the protein pumps ferrari and colleagues linked numerous dox molecules to stringlike molecules called polymers they then infused the dox carrying polymers into their silicon microparticles and injected them into mice that had been implanted with human metastatic liver and lung tumors as with the previous studies the researchers found that the silicon particles congregated in and around tumor sites and once there the particles slowly degraded over   to   weeks as they did so the silicon particles released the dox carrying polymer strands in the watery environment around tumor cells the strands coiled up into tiny balls each just     nanometers across that size ferrari says is ideal because it the same size as tiny vesicles that are commonly exchanged between neighboring cells as part of their normal chemical communication in this case the dox polymer balls were readily taken up by tumor cells once there large fraction was carried internally away from the dox exporting pumps at cell membrane and toward the nucleus ferrari says at this point his team isn sure exactly why the dox laden balls are ferried toward the nucleus though this is exactly what they wanted not only is the region around the nucleus devoid of dox removing pumps but it typically has more acidic environment than near the cell membrane and ferrari team used this to their advantage as well they designed the chemical links between dox molecules and the polymer to dissolve under acidic conditions this releases the dox at the site where its cell killing potency is highest up to   of cancer bearing mice given the treatment showed no signs of metastatic tumors   months later the researchers report today in nature biotechnology in humans ferrari says that equivalent to being cancer free for   years if this research bears out in humans and we see even fraction of this survival time we are still talking about dramatically extending life for many years ferrari says that essentially providing cure in patient population that is now being told there is none the new treatment isn the first nanomedicine to show promise according to recent nanotechnology working group study published in the lancet more than   nanomedicine compounds are now in clinical trials however the new work is promising libutti says because the silicon microparticles tend to target tumors in the liver and lung common destinations of metastatic tumor cells the new work holds out hope for improving the effectiveness of other chemotherapy drugs as well libutti says there no reason to believe you couldn make version of these particles with any chemotherapeutic agent dx idc tnbc     age   stage   grade      cm    nodes ki

       " 'hey guys so ve been trying to do as much research as can before making the post but may as well make some inquiries since m hitting an impasse background had  cc motor that basically soft seized and was getting terrible compression eventually opened it up   months later now that ve got little bit of time and found that the piston certainly had its heyday is pretty much toast now as you can see in the pic the original thread made is here but ll bring you guys up to speed in this thread either way so you don have to read it all viewtopic php     my old motor was getting super low compression   on my oh so world renound harbor freight compression tester so instead of getting new  cc cylinder opted to upgrade so bought an athena  cc kit and dellorto    mm phbn carb with set of jets from   to   which have not installed yet and   br hs plugs to chop yesterday we removed the old cylinder and installed the new  cc athena one disclaimer however we installed the new cylinder piston etc properly lubed up and getting    mm squish as per the instructions but we did not install this rubber ring here because we could not find place for it and it wasn covered in the instructions at all in videos for other cylinder installations the head has place for this rubber ring and you lube it up and place it there when installing the cylinder but the head on my cylinder had no place for it trust me checked every possible way that it could sit there so we installed everything without it and it has the proper squish and everything but of course it seems like probably misunderstood where it supposed to go and therefore put it all together without ever realizing was skipping step however we did everything as legitimately as possible so m not sure which step would ve missed maybe it a totally critical piece maybe it a total non issue piece literally have no idea so the cylinder is installed the reeds are installed the new phbn carb is installed the new spark plug is installed etc tried getting it to start without the exhaust attached which later realize may have been mistake so attached the exhaust but not the airbox and have continued to try and get this thing started thus far to no avail don have an electric start so m working solely with kick starts used the compression tester again and it would give me reading of  psi as to be expected from hf compression tester but after more rigorous kicking it moves up to    psi with more rigorous kicking honestly think could get it up to   but the return spring on my kick starter is super shitty weak and m small man so it physically exhausting to keep kicking and kicking in this hot weather so think my compression is fine with the new motor when we installed the phbn carb we used the needle assembly from the stock carb also of dellorto manufacture because don know how to change them out they appeared to be about the same though update ignore the underlined text replaced the full carb the air screw is set at   and     screws out and m not sure what the fuel screw is at currently planned to tune the carb after it got running but do you guys think need to tune the carb ahead of time just to get the scooter running haven touched the jets or the float at all on the new carb believe the carb is getting fuel since the hose is wet when pull it off the carb the oil line however is dry thus far and m pretty sure need to get new oil hose because the one have is cracking really badly at the mouth and need to zip tie it to keep it on the carb nipple don have any more slack on the hose otherwise would just cut the end and reattach it so need to replace the hose believe so ve ordered parts   and   from here http www jerseyshorepowersports com veh   it may not be the right hose but m hoping it will be in the meantime with the zip tied hose how do get the oil to travel into the carb until the time of writing this post think it has been attached too loosely and just now went out and affixed it more firmly with the zip tie for better seal however temporary how do bleed the line to get rid of the air in the tube the manual mentions bleeding the autopump but when unscrew that bleed screw the oil just comes out right there by the fan cover and not down the hose at the carb end obviously given the physics of the bleed screw location so how do get oil down the line m hoping haven done any damage yet by kicking it over so many times without realizing the oil line wasn affixed firmly read in this post viewtopic php     that it mentions applying vacuum to the petcock to prime the carb and m not sure how to do that all of the pictures in the tutorial have expired m hoping the scooter isn starting simply because haven done enough to prime the new parts for proper ignition but because m in an area where haven seen much literature m no longer sure how to diagnose the situation haven been able to find whole lot of information about what specifically need to do once the new parts are completely installed the good news is that the issue ought not to be problem with cylinder wear since it brand new and has never fired before and once it running ll tune the carb so that wear on the engine is at minimum but can do that yet since can even get it to start read in this thread viewtopic php     that it took op over   kicks to get it started so don know if my issue is because haven given it enough kicks trust me when say was kicking the stool out of that kick starter on the new motor or what but would guess that it because m skipping some important step for prepping new engine setup any ideas thanks for reading guys last edited by hunter on sun jun         pm edited   times in total ',\n",

       " 'uab researchers focus on five key areas to improve care of cvd patients     at     am no comments according to the centers for disease control and prevention approximately     people die of heart disease in the united states every year that one in every four deaths the impact of cardiovascular diseases is quite large the university of alabama at birmingham is home to many talented investigators who study various aspects of heart disease within the school of medicine division of cardiovascular disease at the comprehensive cardiovascular center and across uab primary goal of both the division and ccvc is to actively promote innovative interdisciplinary and translational cardiovascular research many distinct yet often complementary basic and clinical studies are ongoing at uab with alabama ranking among states with the most heart related deaths this innovative research is providing benefits to patients now and in the future uab researchers are focusing on five key areas with an ultimate goal of improving the care of cvd patients heart failure heart failure is chronic progressive condition in which the heart muscle is unable to function adequately and distribute sufficient oxygen and nutrients to meet the body needs in other words the heart cannot maintain its workload multiple researchers at uab are investigating the mechanisms by which heart failure occurs as well as searching for ways to prevent heart failure and devise improved treatment strategies heart failure can arise as consequence of ischemic events such as heart attack indeed heart attack survivors are at increased risk for heart failure development ongoing research is trying to uncover the nature of this relationship during ischemic events the immune system becomes activated which is essential for the repair of the heart however inappropriate activation of immune cells results in chronic inflammation which worsens damage to the heart thereby contributing to heart failure development director of the uab cardiovascular disease division and the ccvc sumanth prabhu d is currently focusing on the role of specific immune cell populations in producing heart damage and on finding way to manipulate immune systems so they do not become hyperactivated similarly research in the laboratory of ganesh halade ph is studying novel lipid species known as resolvins which are able to reverse inflammation in the heart roger white ph and his collaborator m anantharamaiah ph are exploring the anti inflammatory properties of high density lipoprotein mimetic compounds in atherosclerosis and other disease states other important areas of heart failure research involve energetics regeneration cellular survival and remodeling studies in the laboratory of min xie d are currently defining whether activation of self preservation mechanisms such as autophagy promote survival of heart cells thereby attenuating contractile dysfunction following heart attack in terms of remodeling louis dell italia d is studying the mechanisms of extracellular matrix remodeling during heart failure which can lead to stiffening of the heart both xie and dell italia have identified novel therapeutic targets that improve cardiac function in pre clinical models heart failure research further extends to the clinic with multiple active clinical studies assessing the intramyocardial delivery of mesenchymal stem cells as novel therapeutic in patients with heart failure genomic determinants of patient response to pharmacological therapy immune cell activation in chronic disease heart failure outcomes research using the intermacs registry and testing of novel circulatory support devices and other therapeutics in patients with advanced heart failure the studies are led by multiple investigators including prabhu salpy pamboukian d jose tallaj d britta brott renzo loyaga rendon d and deepak acharya d clinical researchers including massoud leesar d seun alli d and brott are examining interventional approaches to ischemic and valvular heart disease and associated cardiomyopathy these include novel strategies for coronary intervention and stent design outcomes after percutaneous structural valvular interventions and developing paradigms for adjunctive anti platelet therapy after interventional procedures nita limdi ph is leading an institutional precision medicine effort to uncover the clinical impact of genomic variation in the metabolism of anti platelet drugs after coronary intervention hypertension research hypertension or high blood pressure typically has no symptoms but can have deadly health consequences if not treated according to the american heart association nearly   million s adults have been diagnosed with high blood pressure suzanne oparil d professor of medicine and past president of the american heart association is part of groundbreaking study called the sprint trial that suggests changing blood pressure guidelines could cause the falling death rate from heart attacks and stroke to drop even more the trial found that pressure below   was preferable for high risk patients number of hypertension patients are unresponsive to conventional treatment strategies these individuals known as resistant hypertensive patients require three or more anti hypertension treatments to help manage their blood pressure david calhoun d professor of medicine in the division of cardiovascular disease is pioneer in translational studies designed to identify underlying mechanisms causing resistant hypertension as well as in the management of this disease paul muntner vice chair of the uab department of epidemiology in the school of public health recently received prestigious grant from the american heart association to study   hour patterns in blood pressure blood pressure usually decreases during sleep an event termed dipping however in some individuals blood pressure does not decrease during the night this non dipping event is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease the study by muntner and colleagues calhoun orlando gutierrez d edward inscho ph oparil david pollock ph jennifer pollock ph

problems in the future when it comes to keeping your heart as healthy as possible there are some factors such as genetics that you can change if you have family history of heart disease then you are at increased risk yourself here we reveal eight steps everyone can take to lower their risk   quit your habit the obvious one is to stop smoking smokers die on average   years earlier than non smokers as shown in study of million uk women published last year if you can stop smoking before you are   you are   times less likely to have health problems than if you continue as well as benefiting your heart you will see rapid improvements in your breathing mood and reduce your risk of stroke diabetes cancer circulation problems and numerous other problems watch your weight the association between heart disease and being overweight is extremely strong not least because obesity puts you at risk of type   diabetes which in itself increases the risk of heart disease and multiple other conditions if you carry more weight around your waist than your hips you are even more at risk to calculate your waist to hip ratio divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement high ratio over     for women or   for men means increased risk of health problems such as heart attacks high blood pressure or diabetes even if you aren that overweight the link between heart disease and weight is extremely strong not least because obesity increases person risk of type   diabetes which in itself increases the risk of heart disease   is fat free best you have probably been advised to cut out saturated fats and replace butter with unsaturated fat spreads this is because diet high in saturated fats is thought to be one factor that leads to high levels of bad cholesterol in the blood which in turn may cause narrowing of the arteries and heart attacks however there is now some controversy as to whether these dietary changes make much difference to your risk of heart disease recent overview of multiple studies found no evidence that restricting saturated fat and increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption lowered the risk of developing heart disease the jury is still out on this one and it shouldn be used as an excuse to eat high fat doughnuts pastries chips and other sources of processed saturated fat however butter cheese and cream in small quantities may not be the complete villains they were thought to be   say bye bye to bacon reducing the amount of red meat is recommended as studies have shown that eating large amount can increase heart failure by up to   per cent however recent evidence suggests that this is linked more to red meat that is processed we re talking ham salami sausages bacon etc with no definite association shown with the consumption of unprocessed red meat the researchers calculated that for each  g of processed meat eaten per day about one or two extra slices of ham the risk of heart failure increased by eight per cent and the risk of death by   per cent these results require confirmation with further studies but as processing can increase the risk of stomach disease too it seems sensible to limit processed red meat wherever possible reducing the amount of red meat is recommended as studies have shown eating large quantities can increase heart failure by up to   per cent but recent evidence suggests this link is more pertinent with processed meats such as bacon salami sausages and ham   eat less salt the british heart foundation is clear that too much salt can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease later in life adults should have less than six grams one teaspoon day cutting back on salt doesn just mean keeping your hands away from the salt cellar when you are eating there is also lot of hidden salt in processed food check the labels and cook from scratch wherever possible then you are in control   say no to sugar large population study in the united states showed that people who consumed more than   per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had an almost three times higher risk of dying from heart disease than those who had less than   per cent independent of other risk factors including weight more and more evidence suggests that too much sugar is contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemic too and as it offers no nutrients whatsoever it is time to cut back gradually reduce the sugar you add to your food or drinks avoid fizzy drinks and look carefully at labels you will be amazed at how much sugar is added to all sorts of food both sweet and savoury study in the us showed people who consume more than   per cent of their daily calories from added sugar had an almost three times higher risk of dying from heart disease than those who had less than   per cent of calories from added sugar   keep active don despair if you are couch potato it never too late to start as well as helping with that weight loss recent study showed that you could get the same heart health benefits if starting exercise such as running or cycling after   as you would have done if you had started before the age of   there are numerous other benefits from exercise too what are you waiting for   stress less and finally while you should be aware of keeping your heart healthy don let it stress you out as stress doesn help your heart either the stress hormone cortisol can increase unhealthy fat around the middle raising your risk of heart problems as well as leading to cravings for high fat and sugar foods which only make things worse so for healthy and happy heart start making

       " 'by scott morgan mount kilimanjaro     meters above sea level is one of the tallest in the world the mountain which is found in northern tanzania has continued to be popular tourist destination over the years the mountain is major challenge to conquer and requires adequate mental and physical preparation to increase the chances of succeeding you need to start training for kilimanjaro early at least two months before the hike the type of physical routine that you get involved in should help you build cardiovascular endurance and your muscle strength weight training helps you improve your performance and helps protect joints such as the ankles knees and the spine which tend to be strained when hiking your target should be to carry backpack of about   pounds as you take flight of stairs at rate of   steps minute the amount of training that is required greatly depends on your initial fitness level persons that have not hiked before will on average require longer duration of physical exercise than those that hike regularly beginners are advised to start by walking outdoors for short distances such as mile and increasing the gradually to say four or five miles take stairs as often as possible it is important that you keep consulting with your doctor to ensure that you remain medically fit the doctor will subject you to full checkup to find out if you have any diseases that would make it difficult for you to go for the hike some of the conditions that may be cause for concern include metabolic disorders such as diabetes chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and cardiovascular disorders such as heart failure and hypotension apart from being physically fit you need to also prepare your body physiologically at high altitude the air is thinner and oxygen supply is markedly reduced high altitude training helps your body to pre acclimatize so that you can cope with such strenuous conditions the best way of achieving this is to be involved in several shorter hiking exercises regularly this can be easily done within tanzania where there are number of smaller mountains near kilimanjaro to be used for practice whether you are beginner or an experienced climber you need to arrive few days earlier this will help you relax and shake off the jet lag at the same time it will give you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with the local climate and food there is at least   chance of making it to the peak if you arrive in good time you need to carry with you number of essential items the technical clothing will typically include hiking pants long sleeved shirt waterproof jacket with hood pair of gloves and sports bra for women important equipment specific to the exercise include map compass or gps sleeping bags and headlamps among others other accessories include towel toilet paper soap and so on persons that are traveling to tanzania need to ensure that they have the proper documentation that will allow them enter the country visa requirements apply to most countries outside the commonwealth ensure that you find out in advance what is required for your specific case it would be unfortunate to miss out on the opportunity after weeks of preparations about the author if you are looking for the facts about training for kilimanjaro go to our web pages online here today further details are available at http www isoldeulrich com now ',\n",

follow up   discussion to the best of our knowledge this is the first case reporting the placement of self expanding nitinol supera stent for the management of perforation in peripheral artery in the past decades significant technical developments have occurred with endovascular therapy of acute thromboembolism which offer several advantages over open surgical embolectomy techniques for the treatment of peripheral arterial thromboembolic occlusion   although the straub rotarex system is widely available and well established for the treatment of such thrombotic lesions perforations of the occluded artery have been described previously and in our case in such cases usually stent grafts are employed however such stent grafts are expensive and are usually deliverable using  f sheaths this may require an additional arterial puncture under full anticoagulation or lead to additional time spent for changing the arterial sheath which may aggravate bleeding complications in our case the sfa perforation could be successfully treated using self expanding nitinol supera stents which are deliverable using  f sheath   conclusion herein we report the placement of self expanding nitinol supera stent for the management of perforation in peripheral superficial femoral artery further novel options of complication management as described in our case may shift the treatment from surgical to even

three weeks since paul was taken my ambulance to mercy hospital er with his heart pounding erratically and two weeks to the day that he was released from the hospital after having catheter ablation to correct atrial flutter click on this link to read that story it been an up and down journey since paul had procedural followup appointment monday of this week between the ablation and this appointment he had couple of bad spells although nothing even remotely close to that which took him to the er in the first place but concerning nonetheless we learned from craig hoffman the physician assistant who saw paul that flutter ablation is about   to   effective naturally we re hoping that paul isn in the   to   for whom it ineffective if the flutter procedure has been successful then what he experiencing when his heart is misbehaving is probably atrial fibrillation but he on medication for that so after thorough discussion we collectively decided paul should wear heart monitor for couple of days to make sure there no flutter and see how frequent and how severe the fibrillation is we learned however that there a third component in the mix sleep apnea also know as obstructive sleep apnea wow was ever ignorant about this condition previously thought well sure you don want to stop breathing altogether when you re sleeping but if it just little pause that always passes no harm no foul wrong at the bottom ve included an article from the national institutes of health national heart lund and blood institute explaining what sleep apnea is and the dangers it poses so paul is going to have sleep study done in the next few weeks we ll figure out what to do from there what is sleep apnea sleep apnea is common disorder in which you have one or more pauses in breathing or shallow breaths while you sleep breathing pauses can last from few seconds to minutes they may occur   times or more an hour typically normal breathing then starts again sometimes with loud snort or choking sound sleep apnea usually is chronic ongoing condition that disrupts your sleep when your breathing pauses or becomes shallow you ll often move out of deep sleep and into light sleep as result the quality of your sleep is poor which makes you tired during the day sleep apnea is leading cause of excessive daytime sleepiness overview sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed doctors usually can detect the condition during routine office visits also no blood test can help diagnose the condition most people who have sleep apnea don know they have it because it only occurs during sleep family member or bed partner might be the first to notice signs of sleep apnea the most common type of sleep apnea is obstructive sleep apnea in this condition the airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep this causes shallow breathing or breathing pauses when you try to breathe any air that squeezes past the blockage can cause loud snoring obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people who are overweight but it can affect anyone for example small children who have enlarged tonsil tissues in their throats may have obstructive sleep apnea central sleep apnea is less common type of sleep apnea this disorder occurs if the area of your brain that controls your breathing doesn send the correct signals to your breathing muscles as result you ll make no effort to breathe for brief periods central sleep apnea can affect anyone however it more common in people who have certain medical conditions or use certain medicines central sleep apnea can occur with obstructive sleep apnea or alone snoring typically doesn happen with central sleep apnea this article mainly focuses on obstructive sleep apnea untreated sleep apnea can increase the risk of high blood pressure heart attack stroke obesity and diabetes increase the risk of or worsen heart failure make arrhythmias ah rith me ahs or irregular heartbeats more likely increase the chance of having work related or driving accidents note from me other research indicates that sleep apnea can also damage the brain the below excerpt is from the sleep foundation researchers have found yet another reason why people with obstructive sleep apnea osa should get tested and treated for the disease according to recent study published in the journal sleep patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome demonstrated reduced brain gray matter concentration gray matter refers to the cerebral cortex where most information processing in the brain takes place and here from webmd is how osa causes or is correlated to increased risks here are seven health problems you might face if you have osa   high blood pressure if you already have it obstructive sleep apnea can make it worse waking up often during the night can cause your hormone systems to go into overdrive which boosts your blood pressure levels when you can breathe well in your sleep the level of oxygen in your blood drops which may add to the problem treatment does make difference though some people with high bp who get help for sleep apnea can cut back on their blood pressure medications   heart disease people with osa are more likely to have heart attacks the causes may be low oxygen or the stress of waking up often stroke and atrial fibrillation problem with the rhythm of your heartbeat are also linked with the condition sleep apnea disrupts how your body takes in oxygen which makes it hard for your brain to control how blood flows in your arteries and the brain itself   type   diabetes sleep apnea is common among people with this condition up to   of them have osa obesity raises person risk for both disorders although studies haven shown clear link between sleep apnea and type   diabetes not getting enough shut eye can keep your body from using insulin properly which leads to diabetes   weight gain extra pounds raise your chances of getting sleep apnea and the condition also makes it harder to slim down when you re overweight you can have fatty deposits in your neck that block breathing at night on the flip side sleep apnea can make your body release more of the hormone ghrelin which makes you crave carbs and sweets and when you re tired all the time you might not be able to turn the food you eat into energy as efficiently which can lead to weight gain   heart disease people with osa are more likely to have heart attacks the

treatment may find they have fewer asthma attacks   acid reflux there no proof that sleep apnea causes this kind of heartburn that doesn get better but many people say that it a problem treating it seems to improve apnea symptoms sleep doctors say   car accidents when you feel groggy that can raise your risk of falling asleep at the wheel people with sleep apnea are up to five times more likely

today friday in the european heart journal   found that in men with bmi of   and over the risk of heart failure increased by   with every bmi unit after adjustments for factors that could affect the findings such as age year of enlistment into the swedish armed forces other diseases parental education blood pressure iq muscle strength and fitness annika rosengren professor of medicine at the sahlgrenska academy gothenburg sweden who led the research said although most studies define normal weight as having bmi between     and   this is probably not an appropriate definition in the young most of whom are naturally thin this may be why we see an increase in the risk of heart failure starting at fairly low bmi level however it was surprising to see the very steep increase in risk with increasing body weight above bmi of   given the global trend for growing numbers of teenagers to be overweight and obese our findings suggest that heart failure which in this study occurred at the relatively early average age of about   may well become major threat to health worldwide this serves to underline the urgent need for action worldwide to curb the obesity epidemic action needs to be taken by governments as well as by individuals for instance by creating an environment that does not promote overweight and obesity and that encourages people not to be sedentary and not to eat more than they need this is more important than hassling people into dieting whatever shape they are once established overweight and obesity is much harder to tackle until recently swedish law required all   year old swedish men to enlist in the armed forces and between   and   total of       men enlisted and underwent standardised physical and cognitive examinations for this study professor rosengren

years during that time     men were admitted to hospital for heart failure with an average age at diagnosis of nearly   compared with men who had bmi of between     and   at the time of conscription men with bmi of   to     had   increased risk of heart failure after adjusting for factors that could affect the results the risk nearly doubled for those with bmi between     and   and more than tripled for those with bmi between   and     the risk increased more than six fold for those classified as obese with bmi between     and was nearly   fold for the very obese with bmi of   or more the researchers say their findings suggest that preventive action needs to be taken earlier in life prof rosengren said current prevention guidelines are meant to guide doctors treating patients with factors that may put them at increased risk of heart and blood vessel problems within the next decade or so the overwhelming majority of young people have an extremely low risk of any such problems and so are not in need of preventive measures on an individual basis except for firm anti smoking advice however our findings show the importance of body weight in adolescence and suggest that more emphasis should be placed on the maintenance of healthy body weight from an early age as preventive measure the researchers point out that limitations to the study include the fact that their findings are only applicable to men and that overall women have lower risk of heart failure than men nor did they have any information on weight gain after the men were conscripted at   so that slightly greater weight at   might be an indicator of an increased risk of subsequently becoming overweight or obese which in itself would be risk factor for heart failure however the strength of the study is

factors such as genetics and age of first impact may play role but what is clear for many researchers is that it occurs because of repeated head trauma that results in buildup of an abnormal protein called tau the tangles of tau can overtake parts of the brain that control for memory mood and aggression the symptoms are similar to alzheimer but begin much earlier there are four stages of the disease and the most severe cases can result in suicidal thoughts   things to know about cte fred jr remembers hearing the headlines of other players dave duerson junior seau and mike webster all seemed to have parallels to his father life that when you start to realize ok yeah the rage the forgetfulness the identity crisis he said gavin even talked to his father about suicide and his dad brushed it off m not going to do that nah nah just joking around gavin recalled it a conversation no son should have with their father all gavin could say was hope you wouldn i love you just know that

would have omalu evaluate his brain we wanted to know she said diagnosing the living in   omalu approached the mcneills with new technology that he had helped developed and is invested in called taumark it uses radioactive tracer called fddnp to bind to tau proteins in the brain the tau proteins can then be seen on positron emission tomography or pet scan omalu explained to cnn that this technology could only be licensed to corporations and that his motive behind it is not profit but research when omalu and his team examined the scan there were angry red splotches all over fred mcneill brain his wife wasn surprised living brain scans of five former nfl players including fred mcneill critics say the test is too early it only been used on   former football players but more importantly they say it isn precise enough it binds to tau as well as amyloid proteins signature for alzheimer omalu said it not just what the marker is highlighting but where the highlights are tau has distinctive pattern in cte and omalu said his test is tracing the tau in the same places he found it in autopsies meanwhile mcneill dementia continued to worsen his outbursts became more extreme

about caring for her husband dementia the letter was the impetus to form the   plan the nfl benefit plan for players experiencing dementia lou gehrig disease and parkinson sylvia mackey gets calls from nfl wives all the time about what to look for and what they can do to help their husbands she recalled when her husband entered nursing home surrounded by folks in wheelchairs who could barely get around she remembers him pushing the other residents in their wheelchairs she said it wasn just the age difference but the pure physical difference of the former football players they need larger beds and larger equipment as the disease progresses and they become less mobile they need lift chairs things they need to help them move around and the staff can shoulder that physically themselves they need equipment to help mackey said fred mcneill was linebacker for the minnesota vikings she also said the former athletes still identify as players brothers of certain bond tia mcneill agrees

       " 'by debra redman lmt nctmb margarette is the picture of health so mini health crisis came as surprise in the same week her divorce was to be final she was scheduled as an outpatient for an ablation type of heart surgery on wednesday and replacement breast implant surgery on friday the post surgical recovery would have most people flat on their backs for more than just few days imagine my surprise when she answered her door for manual lymph drainage massage the day after the heart surgery the immune system does not react well to being over stressed margarette was experiencing very stressful time in her life she had swelling in her right leg from the malfunctioning valve in her heart the collapsed breast implant left her chest feeling heavy as medical massage therapist suggested she relieve some of the discomfort with medical massage modality called manual lymph drainage mld this specialized technique is designed to stimulate the immune system and help the lymphatic system achieve healing in the body margarette received mld both before and immediately after her surgeries pre operative mld cleans the area so that there is little bleeding creating an environment that decreases pain levels and the chance for infection this primed her lymph system to start moving toxins out of her body before the surgeries the effects of mld last up to   hours depending upon the duration of the massage the result is that it slows the amount of bleeding during surgery and causes the body to begin detoxifying the chemicals from the anesthesia and other medications immediately the post operative session kept the process going diminishing pain levels to the point where margarette didn need any medication she recovered so quickly she was back at work by the following wednesday missing only five workdays mld uses very gentle precise strokes to promote the release of fluid build up in the body called edema any interruption in lymph circulation can impair the functioning of the body immune system its ability to repair damaged tissue and cause chemical imbalance in the body if left untreated the swelling could potentially lead to more serious medical condition called lymphedema edema is condition defined as swelling that occurs when interstitial fluid builds up in the muscles of the body lymphedema is build up of fluid in the lymph system unlike edema lymphedema can become chronic condition that has consequences for the whole body swelling pain numbness sensation of pressure increased susceptibility to infection loss of mobility and impaired wound healing are all result of chronic lymphedema chronic swelling has four levels of manifestation micro edema mild or pitting edema non pitting edema and severe hardening the first two can be reversed and usually completely alleviated with mld the last two cannot be reversed but mld may help relieve the symptoms some reasons why the lymph system will respond with edema include illness lack of exercise injury e sports surgery disease and being on an airplane flight mld helps both acute and chronic conditions types of conditions that mld cannot help include kidney disease nephritis leaking blood vessels varicose veins third degree burns congestive heart failure untreated high blood pressure obstructions in the circulation system thrombosis or clots and active cancers most people learn about the effects of lymphedema when they experience cancer based on client feedback very little information is disseminated to non cancer patients about how to take care of the swelling they experience after sports injury accident or surgical procedure not very many people are told about the benefits of mld prior to surgical events or the impact on healing after surgery have discussed mld with heart surgeons podiatrists chiropractors and orthopedic and plastic surgeons it is my concern that few know how to fully utilize mld or pay any attention to the role that edema plays in healing doctors don seem to be addressing the impact chronic swelling has when treating conditions that won heal appropriately have used mld to treat clients who have experienced injuries from sports acute and chronic accidents or surgeries cancer patients in remission parkinson patients pregnant women fibromyalgia chronic fatigue allergies and sinus problems recommend mld for breast cancer prevention

veins maybe when you gave blood and yet they are an integral part of the vascular system that keeps us alive day in and day out whether we think about it or not veins are the blood vessels that carry blood back to the heart and into the lungs to be replenished with the oxygen and nutrients the body needs to function and stay healthy for the blood to get to the heart from the legs it must travel upwards against gravity it does this with the help of the veins and the muscle that surrounds them when we stand and walk the muscles constrict squeezing the veins and pushing the blood toward the heart through system of valves when we sit or at rest the muscles relax and valves within the veins close to prevent blood from flowing back into the legs and feet about   percent of our blood returns to the heart by way of the deep veins veins that lie deep within the body the other two types of veins are superficial and connecting superficial veins are the ones you can see through your skin they carry blood from tissue closer to the surface of your skin to the deep veins where the blood flows to the heart connecting veins carry blood from the superficial veins to the deep veins unfortunately

       " 'about   years ago completed my internal medicine training in upstate new york which included weekly outpatient clinic and ward rotations at the local va hospital love military history and enjoyed the opportunity to talk to many ww ii veterans back then there were even few ww soldiers still around in those days these were everyday working class even humble men who quietly lived common lives but had participated in some of the most storied and celebrated battles in the last century they were part of generation that made tremendous sacrifices and embodied many of the values that made america great it was my privilege to hear some of the stories of this so called greatest generation first hand one ww ii veteran was in my clinic for over two years so was his physician for an extended period time he was tall large man with long grey beard and he always wore confederate cap always thought the hat reflected bit of his gentlemanliness demeanor with just hint of rebel in him he was simple man who although was so much younger basically kid in those days always treated me with the utmost respect and called me doc but never with my last name we got to know each other fairly well as he was in severe chronic heart failure so was seeing him in my clinic on frequent basis to adjust his medications one day he told me his own personal story about the war it turned out he had served under patton in north africa he described the scene of his last battle in that war and in my minds eye felt was there he was on high hill and the germans had overrun and nearly surrounded his position most of his company had been killed or retreated from his position he could see the enemy advancing on three sides it was rock and gravel and sand like the moon there was dust and the smell gunpowder and the smoke and odor of burning diesel and oil the germans could not see his exact location and so were firing indiscriminately up the hill on the other hand from his vantage point he could see the terrain well and was systematically picking off enemy soldiers one at time with well placed rifle shots he was apparently incredibly deliberate and collected under the most intense circumstances his own foxhole buddy was already down but he thought still alive it was only matter of time before they were both either dead or prisoners suddenly the enemy stopped firing and my friend knew that the germans were sending scout to ascertain his precisef location to better target his position he also knew that he only had few moments left so he picked up his buddy in fireman carry and started running away from the enemy positions had he not been carrying his friend he would have been able to move much faster he was nearly over the crest of the hill that would have put him temporarily out of sight and gun range when he was knocked down bullet tore through his left shoulder and upper chest he fell heavily to the ground with gaping chest wound his friend rolled short distance completely inert it was only much later he would find out his buddy did not survive my friend was bleeding heavily but his next breath collapsed his lung and much of the bleeding must have slowed he lost consciousness and awoke in the dark he was unable to get up and drifted in and out of consciousness all night the next day he was picked up by american forces that had reclaimed that territory of the battlefield his wounds were severe and his recovery prolonged but he survived though he never fought in uniform again he was awarded the purple heart but other more prestigious metals of distinction would never come because no one else lived to testify about his heroism he had not told the story to many people he said because he just never enjoyed talking about the war lifetime of cigarettes and alcohol had taken toll on him as he fought other inner battles not the kind of fights that were won by guns or violence when met him as mentioned he was also battling severe health problems remarkably was able to keep him out of the hospital for fairly long time however eventually things fell apart and he was hospitalized and started down hill spiral he had been in for few weeks and just not getting better during that time he had no visitors and he never spoke of family so suspected he was alone in the world was on call every third night which typically meant working   hours straight it was after midnight and visited him in the icu the room was dark and we could only see from the dim lights in the hallway he knew that he only had short time left he thanked me for the care had given him and then started talking about the war again you know doc never regretted the things did or those germans killed knew if didn kill them they would kill me but lately in my dreams m seeing the faces of all those young german boys killed thought to myself their faces pondered if this was trick of his memory but didn ask how close quartered his combat experience had been generally you see an enemy face in hand to hand combat had always presumed the enemy was far away and never really knew exactly how many there had been now in his final battle he was going back to one of his first battles death is the final enemy and my friend knew he was going to the same place to which he had sent others to years ago he died that night alone with his memories and dreams he was soldier patriot hero and had become my friend many of us don really understand the physical and mental burdens our veterans carry with them often for their entire lives it was my honor to know and serve this true hero thank you friend for your service and sacrifice and also thanks to all the countless others who have served in uniform fought killed and even died for our safety and freedom ',\n",

       " 'it done thank goodness so monkeyman went in on thursday early morning without complaint because he couldn eat or drink or had to wake up early just to go and sit and wait and wait and wait at hospital he is such sweet sweet boy having an aspergers child in the house can help but appreciate his cooperation and non defiant behaviour so very very much it makes his and our life soooo easy know it unfair that compare him and his sister but hey they re siblings it impossible not to notice when one child screams her head off about everything and another says yes mom of course mom to every thing you demand of him so monkeyman got to the hospital and entertained himself on his tablet for hours and hours and watched bit of tv we got to talk to all three the doctors before the op the pediatric gastro enterologist ge answered some of our questions and really calmed my nerves the ph doctor came to discuss the procedure and what gerd is etc and was really surprised when she realised not only do we exactly know and that our whole family has it but that she was the one that did my my eldest daughter and eldest son ph studies   years ago as well then came this really really young looking anaesthesiologist it scared my husband bit to trust our son who has had anaesthesia problems into the hands of someone looking like he hasn even finished medical school let alone specialised already but somehow was ok with it thinking that maybe as young dr he would be up to date on all the newest things and it turned out to be true before the operation my husband went to lot of trouble to contact the previous   anaesthesiologist that took care of monkeyman the ge doctor asked him to my husband requested list of all the medications they used and we put all of it together on one page which we presented this newest anaestheologist with he listened carefully to the symptoms and progression that monkeyman experienced every time he received anaesthesia it was always the same he would wake up confused like any normal child screaming fighting crying then in time he calmed down and sometimes would fall asleep when he had the pulmonary hypertension he slept for   hours after the anaesthesia still this is all normal then about     hours after the anaesthesia everytime the vomitting starts doesn matter how strong the anti nausea meds they give him during the anaesthesia this continues for the rest of the day gagging and vomitting inbetween nausea then the physical tiredness he can barely lift his head walking to the bathroom is too much to bear he just lies down on the couch and doesn move for hours and hours about   hours after anaesthesia the fevers starts this continues for about   hours around this time or bit earlier his nose starts to run and it clogs up with his eye tearing exactly like cold the worst isn the symptoms but the fact that you can see this is an ill child that something really is wrong but when you try to tell someone they all say oh but it normal to not feel well after anaesthesia yeah know but this was different the first time he was small child of     years old and we thought that he must ve come down with bug unrelated to the fact that he had anaesthesia just by chance having it at the same time as he wokes up from anaesthesia the second time it was very fishy to see the exact same progression of symptoms but again thought he must ve came down with bug at the same time as the procedure or that maybe the pipe down his throat was to blame he was   then age   he was really really ill we wrote it partly off due to the fact that he had pulmonary hypertension and an enlarged heart but still it really bothered us seeing him so very very ill so whenever someone just mentions possible gastroscopy we back pedalled we just didn want to face the anaesthesia again our instinct was to protect our child and putting him through anaesthesia went through everything we knew was good for him our instincts screamed but we knew at some stage it just simply had to be done so when this dr said it needed we told her about our fears and experiences so she asked us to get list of all the medications used in his previous anaesthesia didn even think it possible but all   doctors came through for us and when we presented the newest anaesthesiologist with the list he said he believe that it the gas that makes monkeyman so ill after the gastroscopy the gastro enterologist came to talk to us for quite while she such sweet caring doctor anyway she said that the anaesthesiologist believes that monkeyman may have malignant hyperthermia she said it   times accentuating it sounds like the anaestheliologist really wanted us to know that he thinks that what it is which makes sense to me when googled it malignant really does mean malignant it scares me big time but at the same time have this huge relief in me one less puzzle to try and figure out possible diagnoses basically it means that gene on one chromosome mutated and makes the body unable to handle gas inhalant anaesthesia the body basically kills itself within hours fortunately monkeyman haven had bad case of it yet just the start of the symptoms like the fever and exhaustion and nausea he must just never ever get gas again then he ll be fine also no cocaine ecstasy or such which don really see as concern at this point know it ll be strange for people to understand the relief of knowing my child probably has malignant hyperthermia but we had this sword hanging over our heads fearing monkeyman next anaesthesia it feels like we have removed that sword now it an enemy we could deal with and we dealt with it it makes me happy and relieved and grateful makes sense so how was monkeyman after the gastroscopy well he was confused for about   minutes directly after the operation he fought and tangled all the wires something terrible then he woke up properly watched tv for an hour ate stood up and walked out of the hospital such trooper no nausea until late the night no vomitting no fever unfortunately still the runny nose clogged sinusses and red and teary eye so so much better but not all symptoms gone no lying down all day no abnormal tiredness nothing he ate and drank normally unlike the previous times just normally tired little boy who had   minutes of anaesthesia really just normal of course he only got iv anaesthesia not gas but he barely flinched when they put the iv in so all in all such an easy child he asked for daddy to go in with him was really so happy about that it wonderful to see their bond and had more than my share of seeing my babies made to sleep the only thing is now just this runny nose and teary eye and clogged sinusses why would anaesthesia do that to him is it still an allergy is it reaction similar to the malignent hyperthermia is it because his immune system is lower than the average child the gastro enterologist was very happy with everything during the operation she found no structural abnormalities like constriction or growths or such no clear signs of issues except that the stomach was quite red abnormally but non specific red she took biopsies of the throat tummy and intestine she also took lot of bloods she gonna get new baseline for him since the last ones was over year ago and then when she was done the ph doctor inserted the ph study while he was still under so that he was saved that trauma at least thank goodness for caring doctors he didn like the little pipe at all it bothered him quite bit as much as it did me shame man but again he was trooper kept him at home and after   hours we went to the ph doctor to take it out she only gave us some prelimenary results she ll send the full report to the ge dr the news wasn good even despite being on high doses of meds  x day already he still had positive gerd test he refluxed  x during the day and  x during the night   of those events didn just rise up into the throat but the contends of the stomach very little acid due to the medication moved right into his mouth poor little boy no wonder he complains about nausea and aspirated his stomach contends when he was on less medication so ya our hopes of lowering his medication dossage was dashed she said we simply cannot do that to him it will damage his lungs to the point where it can kill him she said after     years of aspiration it looks like smokers lungs now we wait for the ge call next week to tell us what the biopsies and bloods shows and her opinion on the reflux report ah well m so good with waiting these days boeboe long road has taught me at least that hahaha no really m ok with the waiting remember how used to complain on this blog about the waiting but ve come long long way have learned patience and perserverance and know nothing ever gets to the point of being fixed so no point in being impatient it not destination it a road with rest stops along the way maybe come to think about it that was the lesson needed to learn maybe that answers the why so many people have asked or mentioned this past few years how come one family could have so many little rare issues they deal with well maybe that was so that could reach this point of acceptance and just founding the joy in the here and now enjoying every day we as family have together ',\n",

threatens to pull us out if we stay frozen ll never forget the first time got swept the doctor said my blood clot was large the biggest he ever seen but had newborn baby but was only   but really wasn ready they said it could be fatal and suddenly their eyes looked at me different as called my family to tell them they needed to come looked at picture of my four daughters before long as they whisked me away to the hospital prayed please god let me be back to raise them at that time while was terror stricken the doctors implanted metal filter in my main vein leading to my lungs to prevent any clots from breaking off and traveling there to kill me remember being awake as they threaded tiny metal basket down through my neck through my heart down into my abdomen safety net they told me until formed another clot above it and that clot became fear in the form of my own body the months after that were beyond harrowing was scared to be alone in case collapsed and the kids were left alone was scared to drive for fear that they clot would travel and kill me and d cause an accident in the process was literally scared to move had talks with the girls about how much loved them they needed to always know talks with justin about if he was faced with raising them alone please be gentle please surround them with loving women please remind them of me fitting everything you want to say in is even harder than it sounds constant appointments several ambulance rides blood tests genetics testing all to later find that the reason d gotten the clot in the first place was because of cluster of events including genetic condition called factor leiden my body once triggered to clot would have difficult time shutting off that process chain effect but even though that was the most terrible time in my life through god grace recovered slowly and timidly nervous to put my toes back in the water the girls grew was grateful to be there to watch it and never took it for granted time marched on but never far from the what ifs of if it ever happened again the fear has stifled imprisoned taunted it has whispered to me in dark rooms and been my alarm clock many mornings had just started getting counseling for what my therapist thought was ptsd from it when suddenly month ago completely out of the blue and four years almost to the day felt that familiar pain again and the panic returned surely it was just anxiety surely just needed to breathe deeper calm my thoughts surely but unable to let it go called the doctor and almost collapsed when after an ultrasound they told me had clot once again the room spun rung my hands can barely remember leaving that place how could this be my path again god didn i suffer enough and the waves were up to my waist fear had returned with his ugly face to whisper see told you so you ll never be able to get away own you but as fear tried once again to take over god voice reminded me that what satan lays out for evil god re weaves for good now ve had weeks of tests blood work and appointments back to the same seat in the clinic waiting room that still somehow feels warm from when left the doctor in order to verify there was no further clotting up higher ordered ct scan he said just to be sure went and shook and tears dripped into my ears as lay there on my back being prepped prayed in that tube staring up at the light painted to look like beautiful sky as if painted cherry blossom and cloud was going to calm me was done soon enough and went home and then waited and waited and waited week went by with no word surely that was good news right surely they would have contacted me by now if something was there they weren expecting by this friday was praying prayer of thanks as pulled into my mom group at church thankful for the grace of each new day thankful for what was obviously good but then got the message the ct scan results had not showed any further clotting but incidentally had seen fluid around my heart note said needed to call my cardiologist right away the message said try not to worry it should have also said definitely do not google but of course did and the findings were so scary that the water around me looked like mud there are many reasons one could develop fluid around their heart and many different levels you could have small effusion caused by virus or illness you could have medium sized one caused from trauma or autoimmune issue or in the worst scenario you could have large effusion that could be life threatening and often had very high mortality rate caused from cancer or bleeding from the heart surely mine was small then told myself felt ok they would have called me to come in right away if it were more serious right spent my weekend in on off fear crying often laughing some thinking constantly the waves slowly moving up further and now around my neck this morning before could even call her the phone rang it was my cardiologist her voice sounded serious as she laid out the next steps to diagnose the whys of this new finding d need an echocardiogram and some blood work to start once they figured out the reason and actual amount of fluid they would know how to treat it she said she had seen the report but would need to know more before she could know how to move forward and then asked it even though didn want to asked what size are we talking ve been looking online and she said the thing didn even think could be well it looks like it large and now was underneath the undertow was so strong heels pitched above my head she said words after that barely heard other than to go to the er if wanted to expedite things and not wait any more days to begin being treated so went barely able to move my eyes side to side knew from my reading that sometimes the large effusions are caused by warfarin which m on for the clot that often in that case the fluid they are seeing is blood that it makes it very complicated to even know how to treat because the blood thinners make the fluid dangerous to drain because you could bleed out but to go off of my blood thinners at this point could cause wide spread clotting from the factor which could also kill me from the minute got to the hospital it was clear my doctor had called ahead was taken in quickly and by half an hour later had had an ekg an iv started   tubes of blood taken blood pressure cuff placed history gone over and chest ray done the nurse entered and said that what they were concerned about was an enzyme indicating impending heart failure that would most likely be admitted soon the doctor came in and repeated what the nurse had said with the addition of indicating d most likely be undergoing trans esophageal echo which would require sedation and was an in patient procedure though walk through the valley of the shadow of death asked to please use the bathroom and when closed myself in stood and begged god begged for miracle and then heard it be anxious for nothing but in all things with prayer and thanksgiving make your requests known to god was forgetting the thanksgiving because isn that just what satan loves to draw our eyes and hearts away from the good that we ve been granted to pull us into something that stifles to call from the dark bushes hey look over here with thanksgiving thankful that they at least caught this thankful for quick moving diagnosis thankful knew that no matter what was about to come he held all of my days in his hands and nothing could separate me from them went back to the room where my mom waited looking concerned asked her if she pray specifically for complete healing specifically said for the issue to disappear those were the words and then something happened five minutes later the doctor appeared with something in his hands do you want the good news or the bad news he said not the bad replied covered in tape and tubes and monitors really don want the bad news at all well that good he said because there isn really any held my breath what was he about to say he said he didn really know how but there appeared to have been typo that it looked like the report had eluded to large pericardial effusion but that for some reason there was no mention of it in the conclusion portion of the report he was seeing he said it should have been highlighted as the number one thing but it wasn even mentioned he thought this was strange when reading it so he had asked to have the scans sent to him and he had called in the hospital radiologist to help him review them he said that after looking at the scans carefully they both agreed that not only was the effusion not large but there was no evidence of any fluid around my heart and my heart was perfectly healthy could hear the second hand tick silence could this even be furthermore he said there was also no evidence of additional clotting and my filter was still in place was free to go home gasp above the surface cried in that moment like crazy person sobbing laughing laugh sobbing and that went on for over an hour as the doctor and nurses and techs came in to say they just couldn believe it and congratulations heard him calling my doctors with the news and suddenly was laying on the shore clothes wet face down but alive and grateful that sometimes when the tide is pushing in it bringing you back in with it because he asks us to trust and keep our eyes fixed and he will quiet the storm because never fails actually means never god did miracle for me today in my physical heart and in the heart at my core the one from where my real life stems two doctors had seen that report and been alarmed enough to have me admitted but suddenly there was nothing there the beautiful sky was looking up at was the real one because he perfects all that which concerns us because the promise is that though we walk through the fire we will not be burned lift my eyes up to the mountains where does my help come from it comes from the maker of heaven and earth the maker of hearts and blood and bodies from the maker of futures the maker of plan for me and the one who sets my feet over and over on solid ground don know what is planned for me because of the strength ve gained through these things don know the people ll meet who might need to hear that ve been there too and made it out alive and they will too don know what lies over the dunes and out into the world beyond this ocean of trial what do know is that my faith was strengthened today after seeing that have faced fear and possible death multiple times and each time have been spared and ever moved up to the dry parts of the shore ',\n",

       " 'what is the kingdom of god where is the kingdom of god is the kingdom of god just another word or synonym in the gospels for heaven the kingdom of god sparks many questions and rightly so when searching the gospels for kingdom of god or kingdom of heaven which appears more often in the gospel according to saint matthew one is amazed by the numerous references throughout the centuries believers have pondered the meaning and implications of the kingdom of god and scholars certainly have grappled with the phrase and filled library shelves with volumes of thought provoking commentaries what can and must we do with the reality of the kingdom in our day in   pope paul vi penned the apostolic exhortation evangelii nuntiandi on evangelizing in our day early in the exhortation the bishop of rome states as an evangelizer christ first of all proclaims kingdom the kingdom of god and this is so important that by comparison everything else becomes the rest which is given in addition only the kingdom therefore is absolute and it makes everything else relative the lord will delight in describing in many ways the happiness of belonging to this kingdom paradoxical happiness which is made up of things that the world rejects the demands of the kingdom and its magna charta the heralds of the kingdom its mysteries its children the vigilance and fidelity demanded of whoever awaits its definitive coming evangelii nuntiandi   clearly pope paul vi sees the kingdom of god has the central experience of jesus public ministry so central that everything in his ministry is grounded in the kingdom similarly the catechism of the catholic church paragraphs   through   examines the manifold depth of the kingdom in jesus public ministry based on these texts as well as other catechetical documents the roman missal and the sacred scriptures have compiled working description note not definition of the kingdom of god that has been helpful to undergraduates deacon candidates seminarians and believers there is certainly much room for discussion in this description and is in no way intended to be exhaustive   the kingdom of god is god our father intervening definitively in the created order the kingdom is not necessarily or strictly specific place although place will be dimension of the kingdom as way of living the kingdom is way of living an ongoing activity initiated by god the father in loving concern for beings that have been created in his image and likeness we have become addicted to sin in such way that we cannot break free from its grip by our own power we have come to enjoy sin too much sin tentacles have woven deeply into our lives that often we cannot see or think clearly we may from time to time have great desires to rid ourselves of sin desires that are marvelous but desires that do not contain within themselves the power to effect what is desired more often than not however sin has dulled our senses to divine love sin has numbed us into complacency and entitlement to the point that we even approach the things of god and church from selfish point of view with no regard to the life of faith as engagement with the divine persons who call me as an individual and as community to ongoing conversion manifesting charity and service to the body of christ so powerless over sin so addicted to the false self we have become that an intervention is needed the kingdom of god   this intervention is work of power power that transforms and surpasses the power of creation god the father work is quintessentially work of restoration not annihilation ask anyone in construction and he or she will tell you that it is often easier to raze building and start over than to renovate or restore renovating an existing structure that does not have level plumb or square line in it makes restoration tedious and time consuming not to mention the surprises lurking behind old plaster and lathe yet ask any restorer when the project is complete and most likely she or he will tell you that in spite of its challenges and frustrations it was and continues to be labor of love such is the kingdom neither creation nor humanity is destroyed the creator does not raze the created order and begin anew even though humanity makes continuous choices reinforcing the addiction to sin the father with eyes of loves gazes upon each human person in such way that each of us are declared precious so precious are we in the sight of god the father that none of us are disposable expendable or useless each of us has particular vocation in the father plan of salvation and our very being is so precious to the father that the loving transforming power of his kingdom calls us from the addiction to our false selves to our true selves as icons of the father love   this transforming power becomes way of living hence not specific place that one can absolutely pinpoint you cannot use google maps or gps device to find the kingdom the kingdom is god the father way of living it is way of living that is the son jesus he lives each moment of his life attentive to his father word and will spending nights in communion with his father jesus teaches with his life that kingdom living is living joined connected related whatever words you wish to use to god the father as way of living the kingdom is radical embrace of the first commandment no one nor no thing nor anything we deem important comes before the father or interferes with our relationship with him kingdom living is life that provides the essentials to sister or brother in need matthew   and celebrates praise and thanks the father for all that he is doing in life cf luke   the magnificat it is in this sense that one can speak of the kingdom as place wherever one is when living as the father commands there is the kingdom   the kingdom as way of living has been prepared by the prophets of old many of the prophets called israel to authentic worship message that is still quite valid despite present misguided and weak arguments that attempt erroneously at division between religion and spirituality for the prophets the spiritual relationship formed by the covenant necessarily bound one religion freely to observe and practice continuous ongoing change of heart the prophets knew that the energy required to live justly as covenant person did not come from within person by himself or herself such living depended upon the mercy of god celebrated and experienced in authentic worship such worship then propelled one to be an instrument of charitable service in the world acting not on one own initiative and power in the name of god   the kingdom as way of living is now definitely revealed and embodied in jesus here all ambiguity concerning the kingdom is erased the kingdom is essentially person the person jesus only he can lead us to the love of the father in the spirit and make us share in the life of the holy trinity catechism of the catholic church paragraph   the incarnation makes the kingdom reality in the created order to effect the father loving transformation of everything most especially the human heart responding and living the love revealed to us in christ jesus is the essential work and live of the kingdom of god is there more to be said about the kingdom certainly but more importantly the kingdom is not intended for study but for living while some of these reflections may give us some insight such insight is always directed to worshipping god the father and serving one another in the name of jesus christ with the gifts and power of the holy spirit as jesus teaching on prayer is proclaimed today at mass consider have thought that the kingdom of god is what does it mean to seek the kingdom of god and his righteousness in view of the kingdom of god am thankful for glory to the father and to the son and to the holy spirit as it was in the beginning is now and will be forever amen top',\n",

treat acute decompensated heart failure during the   months following treatment with ixmyelocel compared to placebo said dr david recker vericel chief medical officer from safety perspective the incidence of adverse events including serious adverse events in patients treated with ixmyelocel was comparable to or lower than patients in the placebo group we are very excited about the results of this clinical trial and greatly appreciate the contributions of the patients investigators and dedicated personnel who participated in this study we have major unmet need in the treatment of class iii and iv heart failure said amit patel d director of clinical regenerative medicine and associate professor of surgery at the university of utah and the chair of the ixcell dcm steering committee based on these positive results we are encouraged that ixmyelocel has the potential if approved to represent an important new option for patients with class iii and class iv heart failure due to ischemic

placebo vehicle control when administered via transendocardial catheter based injections to subjects with end stage heart failure due to ischemic dcm total of   patients with new york heart association nyha class iii or iv heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either ixmyelocel or placebo and   patients were treated at   sites in the united states all clinical events in the primary and secondary endpoints were adjudicated in blinded fashion by an independent adjudication committee the trial met its primary endpoint with patients in the ixmyelocel group having   percent reduction in all cause deaths cardiovascular hospitalizations or unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits to treat acute decompensated heart failure during the   months following treatment compared to the placebo group     the primary endpoint was driven by reduction in both all cause deaths and cardiovascular hospitalizations in the primary endpoint without procedure related events three percent of patients in the ixmyelocel group died and   percent had cardiovascular hospitalizations one or more times compared to   percent and   percent respectively in the placebo group all deaths were adjudicated to be due to cardiovascular causes with respect to the secondary endpoints of the trial the components of the primary endpoint were also analyzed using the win ratio in hierarchical manner to incorporate both the incidence and timing of the endpoint components the win ratio result of     showed that more often ixmyelocel was the winner in that the time to death left ventricular assist device placement heart transplantation or time to cardiovascular hospitalization was shorter for placebo treated patients but this difference did not reach statistical significance the time to first event was longer in the ixmyelocel group compared to placebo but was not statistically significant there were no significant structural changes in left ventricle cavity size or left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by echocardiogram in either the ixmyelocel or placebo groups both treatment groups had an improvement in the nyha class and six minute walk test with no statistical difference between the groups at month   using last observation carried forward overall there were fewer adverse events and serious adverse events in the ixmyelocel group compared to the placebo group adverse events included those typically related to catheterization or injection procedures the ixcell dcm trial showed statistically significant reduction in clinical events driven by both cardiac mortality and cardiac hospitalizations at   months compared to placebo these results are consistent with two previous phase  a studies which showed that ischemic dcm patients treated with ixmyelocel experienced fewer major adverse cardiovascular events during follow up compared to control patients vericel will host webcast at    pm et on tuesday april     to review ixmyelocel and the

everything there will be some people who will not correspond to my concept and will stand by the only possible solution of course for them namely the removal of the radio signals rca or changing the radio and adding an amplifier do not fully coincide do not want to interfere with radio or system of wires and do not want to give up the display want to be in the middle looked like factory the more that the   ka is not car premium but actually for me unless however is if someone does not fit yet can not do this or delegate the task to those skilled in ca but it usually involves the release of thick money or do it your way of course getting the original is possible but easy is not extra price for set of prohibitive started to gain diagrams audio system with jbl and their little analysis needed were the guts bought it on well known site needed were amp eg subwoofer other speakers audio system found have all the parts amplifier can be purchased for approx    z although there are even   pln the subwoofer was expensive approx   pln subwoofer was so actually needed for the speaker but write about it at later stage after the observation namy leniach thoughts and zastanawianiach bought

acquire other speakers according to the abundance pocket it not quide elections speakers anyway about speakers can write and write and always will be an opportunity to do something better there had to be better sound for relatively little money experts ca will be upset that installed speakers in the rear doors because scene breaks perhaps they are right but this is the car family and travel together so if sitting in the back wanted to listen to music would have to increase the volume and this would lead me crazy another purchase was soundproofing mats on the door the choice fell on the

done only the front but look forward to some free time money and ll back plus luggage who knows if not yet tempted to center cursory analysis of patterns found that they are all based on the same standard speaker outputs of the radio it does not matter from what if the rb  rd  rt  or rd  are connected directly to the amplifier jbl on the other hand we work out the sounds of the individual

pin plug for rb d  when buying an amplifier got to set the plug into it what greatly helped me alteration talking with friend from krakow cheers robert hinted at matching connectors from something else but the   ki as someone wants can call him and add it here now the question of assembly thought long time to solve the problems associated with placement of everything in the car and after long deliberation decided to mount the amplifier in the glove box checked that it can not be damaged legs and hence the decision in addition was in this location close to the plug in radio leaves the assembly and pulling wires this contributed to the lowest possible interference in the wiring the need to perform beam combining speaker output on the radio input of the amplifier amplifier output plug into speakers by doing it we can come back in minute earlier calls without repeater soon there will be some who find that the original wiring is to sure they are partially right but if the factory radio has an output power of approx    w rms and this amp has  w rms so see no need to change cables tedious and time consuming how do know that the amplifier is  w because like real man got under it and read the scalaczk their name tda q class amplifier working in the bridge in the notes directory you can read his power to be  w   thd   and    v power this power is available for each channel will not elaborate on the power amplifier refer eg here www alldatasheet pl datasheet pdf pdf   philips tda q html the amplifier has   systems tda q so we get   scalak front and woofers   scalak front and tweeters   scalak back and broadband   scalak back  st and  nd subwoofer amplifier jbl is not such amplifier have in addition to the power amplifiers filters separating the frequency band of the specific type of speaker separated only the front and subwoofer pay attention to the output of the amplifier subwoofer it feeds the subwoofer speaker consisting of two coils in one case speaker speaker double solenoid by the way wonder if it would be proven design with two separate speakers in one enclosure with the structure and patterns that can not be like that connect the speakers as you want you need to connect them exactly as predicted manufacturer you would not get the effect you expect or even uszkodzimy amplifier speaker and yes the pins   and   and   and   are intended only for the subwoofer output pins   and   and   and   are used only for output front tweeters there is no need to use crossover filter frequency division for specific speakers because they have done so already integrated in the amplifier the rear speakers are tweeters they must be equipped with capacitor odseparowuj cy the bass usually do somewhere in the depths of the internet found the characteristics of the amplifier jbl as you can see the producers already took care of the distribution of frequency and damping unfortunately in my sw missing pillar no place in the plug due to the established folding mirrors so had to tighten the tweeter additional cables using the upgrade connector one steam purchased from your local electronics store for    z pcs those who do not have the option full electrics mirrors will not need it because they will have more space in the plug with the whole fuss with speaker cables is only tightening the wires to the subwoofer and whistles front subwoofer the number of wires   two pairs chose to wires  mm  mounting leave already own creativity interested because of the banality of execution this connection is done by laying the cables in the original factory mounts along the threshold of the car under the carpeted floor trivial solution and the easiest dismantle need only the lower part of the door seals and plastic in the middle column fastening of seat belts until the end of yet switched on the radio options output settings from the speaker to amp the program pp  but here it is the pogadania do not know what miracle but have two radio rd    clarion which behave differently ie one set to have speaker and the second the enhancer and then play both good but the change in their value on the contrary is both play quietly do not know why like it the same receivers do not know whether zatrybicie to this translation of course will not elaborate on the correct installation and caution and accuracy as well as for checking all across the stage adaptive audio system because think the case is clear in this regard now matter subwoofer made chest size under the trunk so that it nicely komponowa a whole measured the capacity of the factory for the subwoofer speaker and it came to me that is   liters made your subwoofer design matched to the sw and my thanks to the  mm mdf board got similar result well maybe little bit bigger well that little boy still learning it helped me to calculate because thanks slants and tilts the side wall and the front it was not as easy as an ordinary simple case and wanted to know exactly how much liter this project the hardest part was cut the wall plate with slants square meter board costs in koszalin approx pln   enough was enough in my project and still is the entire casing is made of closed own so mad ni ma design chest leaned on several filmikach which are available on youtube the cut actually milled grooves serve to mask the connections of material such solution also found the net somehow it was called but do not remember how why housing closed because she can forgives many mistakes all the walls are glued and screwed screws chose flat head because after drilling plates larger drill nicely hide and you can not feel the material inside and outside whole lakierowa em clear acrylic lacquer additionally the connection between the walls sealed with clear silicone veneer material blanket glued glue upholstery as you can see was able to choose even the color now question of mounting the subwoofer as you can see in the pictures below chose to mount towards the left do not remember why but had to be reason fixing the subwoofer is little strange but unfortunately to date have not found another important it works well to secure the speaker to be removed and what next well you need to remove one of the mounting studs bacon and through this opening to postpone the screw that has to go through accordingly to the drilled hole in the rear of the subwoofer after twisting the whole body is not going to fly the trunk of course the hole in the wall secured silicone then mount the speaker and grille what got actually that probably not envy the wife of the original jbl anyway stated that the sw game somehow better the effect is probably worse than the ca for  z but as said with age but the hearing is deteriorating s such were the stages of the

contemplating in fact ve been talking so much about death in recent months that my kids and husband keep razzing me about it ve sent them memos about what want and don want at my funeral no open coffin in fact no body or casket funeral service for immediate family only some time later party open house memorial service with no eulogies only extemporaneous anecdotes with lots of food wine and music ve already worked out the entire mix of songs want heavy on led zeppelin and queen before her death my mother the world most organized person had written down the hymns and scripture readings for her funeral specified cremation and purchased the mausoleum niche where her ashes and my father would be stowed in brass boxes that resemble books she chose niche which had view of the swans on the cemetery pond she had all their financial affairs in order filed neatly in her desk when she died my father on the other hand had dementia as well as parkinson disease until he died at   so he didn even known when my mother died his dementia first became evident at our parents fiftieth wedding anniversary in   when he was about   needless to say ve been watching myself for signs of alzheimer and avidly doing lumosity brain games every day daughter marina kindly signed me up knowing my worry about memory loss realize as recent articles have pointed out that lumosity doesn really help you stave off dementia it just measures how you become better at the games with practice but nevertheless it gave me comfort that yesterday workout results put me at     lpi whatever that is as compared with my age group and     for problem solving but only     for memory was happy that my numbers had gone up but then realized that overnight the age group was being compared to had changed

make up area the library and especially my closets one at time tons of papers have to go all those books ll never read again will be donated to the grafton library for sale all my office appropriate clothes will go to dress for success so that other younger women can find jobs ve told the kids whatever they want take it now in hopes of avoiding as among my mother nine siblings bitter schisms between two children who want the same antique bureau as the day of my  th birthday moved from morose reflections over coffee to astonishment at the sight of over   birthday wishes on the internet alternated between tears over the card my husband gave me and laughter for instance when daughter eleni posted on facebook did you know that on her  th birthday witnessed this woman sip from hash milkshake in amsterdam trust me she was in it for the milkshake happy birthday party girl was delighted to receive calls and gifts from son chris and daughter marina both on the opposite side of the country and chuckled at the books marina sent the alzheimer prevention program keep your brain alive and   uses for grandma among them at the end of the day at dinner in the romantic restaurant casa tua in south beach fl nick and told each other how lucky we are that we ve made it through   years of marriage that we have three great kids and two extraordinary grandchildren and that when we get up in the morning no parts of our bodies hurt that a rare blessing when your age group is over   so by the time the waiter brought birthday cr me brul with candle in it as well as chocolate meltdown both

       " ' naturalhealth  recent study is now showing strong evidence of link between lack of vitamin and poor cardiovascular health the study results show that low vitamin levels have been linked with higher risk of having heart attack stroke or heart failure among other health issues the results come from an innovative study conducted by the intermountain medical center heart institute of salt lake city the study findings were presented at the american college of cardiology scientific sessions in chicago avoid low vitamin levels this is powerful way to protect your heart higher risk of stroke heart issues and cardiac events seem to correlate with low levels of specific vitamin component as well as deficient overall levels the researchers found that those with low vitamin levels in both bioavailable and total amounts had more cardiovascular health challenges bioavailable vitamin refers to vitamin in the bloodstream but not attached to proteins for the study lead researcher cardiovascular epidemiologist dr heidi may and her colleagues studied vitamin levels in     older adults around   percent of the participants showed coronary artery disease and quarter had diabetes the research team looked at levels of vitamin elements produced during metabolism to find connections to future cardiac issues studying the unbound bioavailable vitamin was key as only   to   percent of vitamin can act during metabolism however both total vitamin levels and bioavailable amounts were accurate in predicting the risk of heart issues down the road vitamin is crucial to many areas of your health profile the study ultimately concluded that people with higher vitamin levels had the lowest risk of heart attack heart failure stroke and death the study underscores the importance of vitamin to overall health throughout our lifetime other research has shown how important vitamin is to memory cognitive health and avoiding alzheimer in older age as well persons already experiencing coronary health issues should consider having their vitamin levels checked and take action if lack of vitamin is detected doing so could be crucial to cardiovascular and overall health sunshine diet and supplements can all provide vitamin while vitamin can be prescribed or taken in supplement form one of the best ways to receive it is from the sun it should be noted that people of different races tend to process vitamin at different levels those with darker skin may require more supplementation regardless of sun exposure foods that are rich in vitamin include fatty fish like salmon sardines and herring raw milk and some breakfast cereals contain vitamin but one must be careful about food allergies if they exist in addition whole eggs mushrooms and ricotta cheese offer vitamin but again

results of randomized controlled trial   division of gastroenterology faculty of medicine university of calgary calgary ab canada   departments of medicine and community health sciences university of calgary calgary ab canada   forzani macphail colon cancer screening centre alberta health services calgary ab canada   division of gastroenterology faculty of medicine university of ottawa ottawa on canada received   august   accepted   october   copyright   rachid mohamed et al this is an open access article distributed under the creative commons attribution license which permits unrestricted use distribution and reproduction in any medium provided the original work is properly cited abstract background the efficacy of colonoscopy in detecting abnormalities within the colon is highly dependent on the adequacy of the bowel preparation the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy safety and tolerability of peg lavage and split dose peg lavage with specific emphasis on the cleanliness of the right colon methods the study was prospective randomized two arm controlled trial of   patients patients between the age of   and   years were referred to an outpatient university screening clinic for colonoscopy patients were allocated to receive either single   peg lavage or split dose peg lavage results overall the bowel preparation was superior in the split dose group compared with the single dose group mean ottawa score         versus         and resulted in less overall fluid in the colon this effect was observed across all segments of the colon assessed conclusions the current study supports use of split dose peg lavage over single large volume lavage for superior bowel cleanliness which may improve polyp detection this trial is registered with clinicaltrials gov identifier nct    introduction the efficacy of colonoscopy in detecting abnormalities within the colon is highly dependent on the adequacy of the bowel preparation despite advances in bowel preparation the process remains difficult for patients to tolerate and complete and ultimately if inadequate can result in missed lesions   with published literature on missed polyps and carcinomas at colonoscopy     optimal visualization of the colonic mucosa becomes critically important furthermore some evidence suggests that colonoscopy may not be protective against right sided colonic lesions     subtle flat lesions with predilection for the proximal colon particularly those with serrated histology are becoming increasingly significant as potential factors for the lack of protection of colonoscopy proximally and stress the importance of adequate preparations     background polyethylene glycol peg is balanced electrolyte lavage rather than an osmotic agent therefore its use as bowel cleansing preparation is typically associated with fewer fluid shifts and electrolyte abnormalities compared with low volume osmotic agents   it has been widely used for colonoscopy preparation on its own     or in conjunction with other agents     one disadvantage of the traditional   peg bowel preparation is reduction in the quality of cleanliness with afternoon procedures   which has driven further research into timing and dosing of peg depending on timing of the procedure     in our previous study the   peg preparation was somewhat inferior to sodium phosphate preparations now removed from the market because it left large amount of residual fluid in the colon   however the use of split dose of peg   the day before the procedure and   the morning of the procedure may alleviate some of the shortcomings of single   preparation particularly for afternoon procedures   the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of single and split dose peg lavage with specific emphasis on the cleanliness of the right colon and the influence of endoscopy time   materials and methods all patients between the age of   and   years referred to the forzani macphail colon cancer screening centre in calgary alberta canada for colonoscopy in   were considered for inclusion during preassessments at the clinic patients were asked to participate in the study by nurse clinician those not interested in participating simply received the centre standard bowel preparation protocol patients with acute coronary syndrome congestive heart failure unstable angina known or suspected renal failure ascites megacolon known or suspected bowel obstruction or other comorbidities that may prevent colonoscopy were excluded patients were also excluded if they previously had partial or subtotal colectomy or if the colonoscopy was warranted for the evaluation of diarrhea enrollment of participants was performed by study coordinator computer was used to generate randomizations table with blocks of   allocation concealment was maintained through the use of consecutively numbered sealed envelopes the allocation ratio was     colonoscopists and investigators were blinded to the allocation groups patients were allocated to one of two groups     peg the day before the procedure starting at noon for am procedures and     pm for pm procedures or     of peg in split dose procedure before   am   at   noon and   at   pm the day before the procedure procedure after   am   of peg at   pm the day before the procedure and   of peg   hours before the scheduled procedure time on the day of the procedure study assistant assigned patients to their group and instructed them on the proper use of their assigned bowel preparation method patients were instructed to start low residue diet   days prior to the colonoscopy table of acceptable foods white bread white pasta dairy eggs chicken beef pork fish cooked or steamed vegetables and canned fruits and foods to avoid whole grain brown or wild rice oatmeal raw fruits and berries any food containing nuts seeds and popcorn was included in the patient handout patients were instructed to take light breakfast on the morning before the procedure followed by clear fluids thereafter patients were given tolerability questionnaire that was modified from previously reported questionnaire   to be completed once their bowel preparation was finished and before coming to the hospital for the colonoscopy patient concerns or questions regarding the preparation were directed to the assistant as opposed to their gastroenterologist so as to avoid unblinding the gastroenterologist     outcomes the previously validated ottawa bowel preparation scale   was used to assess the quality of bowel cleanliness each of the right mid and rectosigmoid colons was rated on   point scale     in addition overall colonic fluid was assessed with   point rating     resulting in an overall score range of   to   an excellent preparation with little fluid would have score of   to   and good preparation would have score of   to   an adequate bowel preparation would have score of   or lower and completely unprepared colon would have score of   to   depending on the amount of colonic fluid colonoscopy was performed in standard fashion and endoscopists rated the bowel preparation quality during the procedure before any attempts to improve visualization and recorded the result on separate standardized form secondary outcomes included tolerability questionnaire as well as patient and investigator reported adverse events     statistical analyses descriptive statistics were used for baseline characteristics the ottawa bowel preparation scale produces data that are approximately normally distributed two group anova was used to assess for the presence of group differences in the preparation scores while accounting for procedure time am versus pm the proportion of adequate bowel preparation in each group was compared with chi square statistic the secondary endpoints of tolerability were assessed using the mann whitney test     sample size calculation in our previous study using the ottawa bowel preparation scale an observed effect size of     was seen   for two group anova total sample size of   patients would be required for two tailed alpha at     and an   power based on experience from our previous study an additional   of patients were added to the total sample size to account for early withdrawals and incomplete colonoscopies   results in total   patients were enrolled in the study   in the split dose group and   in the single dose group   completed the study   patients in the single dose group and   patients in the split dose group discontinuations

groups in the split dose group   underwent afternoon colonoscopies compared with   in the single dose group table   baseline characteristics of the patients the differences in ottawa score between the two groups are illustrated in figure   in total the bowel preparation was superior in the split dose group compared with the single dose group mean ottawa score         versus         split dose peg resulted in lower and therefore better mean ottawa score across all segments of the colon assessed as well as less overall fluid in the colon this reached statistical significance for the total right and left colon furthermore the split dose group had higher proportion of patients with adequate bowel preparation ottawa score   than the single dose group     versus     figure   figure   ottawa

prep score   for split dose and single dose peg lavage groups split preparations for morning procedures were performed only for those procedures after   am as earlier procedures were not feasible to have patients take an early morning dose of their preparation in procedures performed in the morning the split dose peg lavage resulted in lower total ottawa score compared with the single dose lavage mean total ottawa score         versus         the ottawa score in the right colon was significantly better in the split dose group than in the single dose group         versus         the differences in ottawa score between the two groups for morning procedures are illustrated in table   table   mean ottawa scores parameters for morning procedures the effect of the split dose lavage compared with the single dose lavage is amplified in the afternoon procedures the total ottawa score was far superior in the split dose arm         versus         as were the independent assessments of the different colonic regions right colon     versus     mid colon     versus     left colon     versus     all the differences in total ottawa score with the split dose and single dose peg lavage for both morning and afternoon procedures are illustrated in figure   figure   bowel preparation quality for am earlier than     am and pm after     am procedures all single dose patients took their bowel preparation   peg the day before the colonoscopy starting at noon for am procedures and     pm for pm procedures split dose patients took the second dose the evening before colonoscopy for am procedures or   hours before the colonoscopy time for pm procedures both preparations were generally well tolerated and completed as directed by the majority of participants   in split dose group versus   in single dose group questions regarding tolerability of the lavage preparations are shown in table   more patients who took the single   lavage would rather have had different preparation method compared with those who took the split dosing the mean number of adverse events experienced during the lavage was higher in the single dose group compared with the split dose group     versus     adverse event data are provided in table   table   questionnaire patient opinion regarding the assigned bowel preparation table   adverse events group symptom score   discussion administration of peg lavage in two   doses is superior to administration in single   dose for screening colonoscopy in an outpatient population the result is an overall better cleanliness in all regions of the colon as well as less residual fluid while this holds true for procedures performed throughout the day the effect is amplified when there is shorter interval between the last dose of peg and the procedure as was the case in the afternoon procedures where the second peg dose was given in the morning of the day of the procedure in this situation the difference in total ottawa score between the split dose and single dose preparations was the greatest while there was still significant difference in morning procedures where the last peg dose was given the evening before the effect was less dramatic this begs the question as to whether patients with morning procedures should be asked to take the second peg dose     hours before the procedure rather than the evening before at least in the setting of colorectal cancer screening clearly this puts significant added burden on patients with scheduled morning procedures there are variety of reasons as to why split dose administration of peg is superior to single dose administration the second dose of the split preparation is given closer to the procedure time than is the single dose the result is likely better removal of fluid and debris that may have accumulated in the hours since the first dose of the peg lavage       the single dose of peg is almost always given the night before the procedure leaving several hours since the laxative was administered for fluid bile and debris to accumulate therefore the bowel becomes less clean over time matro and colleagues have recently shown equivalency for morning only and split dose peg preparation pm am for afternoon procedures suggesting that the earlier dose may not even be required   another study found that maximal cleanliness of the bowel preparation was achieved when the colonoscopies were performed within   hours of the last laxative dose   this notion is supported in our study by the superior bowel preparations in the afternoon procedures the effect was less pronounced in the morning procedures likely because of the increased time between the second dose evening before and the colonoscopy time in our study afternoon procedure cases received the second dose of peg   hours priorly better bowel preparation has been associated with higher cecal intubation rates and higher polyp detection rates   in study by marmo et al split dose peg lavage outperformed single dose peg lavage for colonoscopy the improved bowel preparations were associated with   fold increase in cecal intubation and   fold increase in adenoma detection   the superiority of the split dose lavage in the right colon shown in this study and others   facilitates better identification of the serrated adenomas which tend to be flat and more difficult to detect polyp and adenoma detection rates are typically descr ',\n",

       " 'invc news new delhi world leading cardio and endovascular technology maker biotronik today introduced in india its latest and most advanced home monitoring technology for patients with implanted cardiac devices such as pacemakers implantable defibrillators icds and heart failure devices biotronik home monitoring is an internet based remote monitoring technology that enables physicians to continuously and reliably monitor their patients clinical and device status anytime anywhere and minimize risk of any negative medical event the latest device in the biotronik home monitoring program the cardiomessenger smart is about the size of smartphone and is highly robust more convenient and remarkably portable as compared to previous versions of the device having the pacemaker wearers constantly connected to their physician this home monitoring technology enhances safety for cardiac device patients the device provides fully automatic transmission of vital information from patient cardiac implant to their physician via biotronik home monitoring data are transmitted from the patient implant to the cardiomessenger transmitter device which uses mobile and its partners networks gprs to send data to the biotronik service centre from where the data is sent to the physician home monitoring has helped doctors world over to keep very close look at their patients implanted devices and their cardiac activity it has helped reduced mortality episodes of hospitalizations and inappropriate shocks and helped improve the quality of life of patients immensely it helps use of the full potential of the device that preserves battery life it has also helped reduce routine clinic follow up which can be burden to patients and extra workload for physicians these results formed basis for the class a indication which means this is considered as standard of best care this was the recommendation by the heart rhythm society and is endorsed by the other professional societies around the world including asia pacific heart rhythm society said dr niraj varma electrophysiologist at cleveland clinic ohio usa who co chaired this document dr varma says home monitoring has clinically shown to have helped doctors provide improved services and helped better the health conditions of patients the cardiomessenger smart facilitates the application of home monitoring results from large clinical show the following benefits of home monitoring mortality in heart patients less by   hospitalizations due to atrial arrhythmia or stroke less by   in office follow ups less by   risk of inappropriate shocks in patients with implanted devices less by   another advantage of constant remote monitoring is that we as physicians get closer look at trends in different patients some patients might have more stable heart activity with cardiac device others may have more frequent discrepancies and episodes of arrhythmia by regular monitoring data over period of time we can understand each patient and tailor our treatment and advice according to their needs and optimise device function it also helps better our medical understanding and gives vital data for research regular monitoring of patients wearing pacemakers and other devices has traditionally been cumbersome task since patients are required to visit clinics at regular intervals in country like india where patient from bihar might have had device implanted in delhi follow up visits can be very difficult sometimes medical event in between the visits could go unnoticed and be life threatening to the patient home monitoring has made it easy enhanced safety and also reduced cost said dr viveka kumar senior consultant interventional cardiologist director of the cath lab at max hospital new delhi biotronik home monitoring is the only remote monitoring system worldwide with us fda and european ce approval to replace conventional in office follow ups and provide early detection of clinically relevant cardiac events it is the only system with fully automated data transmission no patient interaction is needed leading to the highest possible patient compliance physicians can define the events they wish to be notified with via email sms or fax and view the events in order of importance regular data recording allows significant trend analysis help physicians understand each patient condition and adjust their treatments accordingly the process also allows better scheduling of follow up appointments which may be skipped if not needed digital technology has drastically changed the way we live and its impact on healthcare is also profoundly visible today the indian government special emphasis on digital india shows how it and digitization is inextricably linked to

americans who suffer from atrial fibrillation af or afib racing heart is way of life simple tasks like getting out of bed in the morning or rising from chair can cause dizziness weakness shortness of breath or heart palpitations for these people af severely impairs quality of life and even when symptoms stemming from af are mild the disorder can seriously impact health increasing the risk of stroke and heart failure af can be debilitating even deadly condition fortunately it can be successfully managed but there are various approaches for treating af or preventing recurrence how do you and your doctor choose which approach is right for you if you or loved one has af there are so many questions do need an anticoagulant should be taking medication to control my heart rate will my

is the af experienced by an otherwise healthy person different from that of person with underlying heart disease or other health issues what are the differences among paroxysmal af persistent af and longstanding persistent af what options are available for controlling my af symptoms what if antiarrhythmic medication fails to suppress af episodes anticoagulation therapy what you should know while af is generally not life threatening for some patients it can increase the likelihood of blood clots forming in the heart and if clot travels to the brain stroke will result anticoagulation therapy is used to prevent blood clot formation in people with af but it is no longer restricted to the mainstay blood thinner warfarin coumadin three new anticoagulants have now been approved by the fda pradaxa

within therapeutic range with warfarin how is the has bled bleeding risk score used in prescribing anticoagulant therapy can test my inr test measuring how long it takes blood to clot at home what happens if my inr is too high is there still role for antiplatelet therapy in af related stroke prevention is there point when patient can stop anticoagulant therapy symptom control the art of rate and rhythm control for many patients and their doctors it difficult to achieve and maintain heart rhythm two key management strategies are used heart rate and heart rhythm control in atrial fibrillation the latest management strategies you ll read an in depth discussion of the effects of rate versus rhythm control for af and who the appropriate candidates are for each strategy what have we learned from the affirm study and how has this knowledge affected the management of af what is catheter ablation of the av atrioventricular node why is cardioversion needed are there different types of cardioversion what is chemical cardioversion what is electrical cardioversion can medication be used to convert the heart back to normal sinus rhythm which antiarrhythmic drugs are most commonly used to treat af when is catheter ablation of af an option and how is it performed who are the best candidates for catheter ablation of af what can be done if catheter ablation isn successful there more to atrial fibrillation the latest management strategies much more we explain surgical ablation of af procedure performed through small incisions in the chest wall discuss when it appropriate to seek second opinion take close look at strokes and explain the warning signs and differences among ischemic thrombotic embolic and hemorrhagic strokes provide chart of current drug

       " 'in surgery there have been certain periods when advancement in knowledge and technical inventions have had marked effect on our life and the surgeon ability two quantum leaps occurred in the late  th century which together allowed the transition to modern surgery the first great advancement was the discovery and use of anesthesia especially ether to enable the surgeon to work without causing pain and the inevitable accompanying shock which would be life threatening subsequent new agents and newer delivery methods have eliminated the bad effects of the original drugs an appreciation of the germ theory of disease led rapidly to the development and application of antiseptic techniques in surgery antisepsis which soon gave way to asepsis reduced the overall morbidity and mortality of surgery to far more acceptable rate than in previous eras the next major advancement was as the result of the spanish civil war when an understanding of shock and its treatment in traumatic injuries proved to be lifesaving in the post wwii era starting in the late  s combination of better anesthesia techniques and shock support plus better understand of the body hemostasis led to greater surgical advances to the point where we can now even transplant organs included in these advancement were the use of new visual tools as well as the computer and micro surgical development so called non invasive the first heart valve replacement happen in the   it was rather brutal procedure and took such great toll on the body that the majority who needed the operation the most especially the elderly over   had little chance of surviving the operation am unawares of anyone in the  s being offered the procedure the operation was done by splitting the sternum breast bone down the middle then the heart is exposed the pericardium is opened and the patient is put on cardiopulmonary bypass machine also known as the heart lung machine this machine takes over the task of breathing for the patient and pumping their blood around while the surgeon replaces the heart valve before its invention the heart continued to beat and made it difficult to place the valve further advancement was the addition of the use of hypothermia lowering the body temperature early adoption of this technique proceeded slowly based on the limitations of available replacement valves and relatively primitive techniques for protecting the heart during surgery which were available at the time with the evolution of mechanical heart valves and gradual developments in cardiopulmonary bypass the heart lung machine and cardioplegia which allow the heart to be stopped safely during surgery aortic valve replacement became accepted therapy for patients with severe aortic insufficiency and or regurgitation once the patient is on bypass cut is made in the aorta and cross clamp applied the surgeon then removes the patient diseased aortic valve and mechanical or tissue valve is put in its place once the valve is in place and the aorta has been closed the patient is taken off the heart lung machine transesophageal echocardiogram tee an ultra sound of the heart done through the esophagus can be used to verify that the new valve is functioning properly pacing wires are usually put in place so that the heart can be manually paced should any complications arise after surgery drainage tubes are also inserted to drain fluids from the chest and pericardium following surgery these are usually removed within   hours while the pacing wires are generally left in place until right before the patient is discharged from the hospital recovery from this operation usually takes about   months or more as medical procedures evolved cardiac cauterization became standard and not only could the heart blood vessels be visualized but the placing of stents instead of open heart coronary heart surgery became possible and common treatment in   only   years ago the first aortic valve was replaced by using catheter inserted through the femoral artery and passed into the heart hospitalization was now no more than   days if there were no complications which were much less than in open heart replacement now those in the  s could be treated instead of facing rapid progress heart failure within week or two the patient could depending on his heir status resume normal life these valves folded up so that they could be passed through the catheter and were then open when in the area of the valve to be replaced and anchored into position they consisted of metal framework covered with plastic and the valve itself was usual from pig tissue the metal frame help anchor the valve in place the operation is called trans aortic valve replacement tavr today new and better valve for many reasons is undergoing clinical trial in the usa although it has been in use in europe for about   years it has no metal and is secured in place by expanding it as if it were balloon and then hardening polymer is injected to fix it in place if the surgeon does not like its initial positioning he deflates the balloon and reposition it under the ultrasound and fluoroscope guidance before injecting the fixing agent it will be only be matter of time when all valve replacement will be done by this less traumatic method ',\n",

and fats and opting for organic non gmo foods whenever possible let explore in more detail why clean eating is so important and look at   tips for eating clean that can immediately begin transforming your relationship with food cut back on added sugars americans consume shocking amount of added sugars every day on average adults take in     teaspoons   ounces of added sugars which equates to around   calories to help you visualize   ounces is around the size of deck of cards of sugar every day most added sugar is consumed in the form of soft drinks the many different kinds of sugar additives in processed foods and candy cakes cookies pies and pastries sugar adds calories to food while contributing zero nutritional value aside from energy carbohydrates high sugar diet is linked to obesity metabolic syndrome insulin resistance that can lead to diabetes hypoglycemia heart disease high blood pressure depression gout headache fatigue it important to be mindful of the amount of sugar in the food you are eating as well as the type of sugar it also helps to eat foods with good amounts of fiber as it slows the body absorption of sugar limiting consumption of highly processed added sugars is an essential part of clean eating distinguishing between natural and added sugars in prepared foods can be confusing for consumers that why some consumer groups are petitioning the food and drug administration fda to require disclosure of added sugars on nutrition labels how much is okay the world health organization who recommends no more than   teaspoons   grams of added sugar day ditch refined grains refined grains are less nutritious because they have been stripped of their bran and germ the most fibrous parts of the plant as in fruit the fiber in grains is what slows the absorption of sugars when blood sugar levels rise too quickly the result is spike in insulin which over time can increase your risk of diabetes there has been lot of backlash against the idea that refined grains are less healthy especially white rice but we stand firm whole grains are simply the healthier choice choose whole grains like whole wheat steel cut or rolled oats brown rice quinoa amaranth flax and barley watch salt intake americans consume far more salt on average than the recommended     mg maximum per day sodium easily hides in packaged foods sometimes in surprising quantities read nutrition labels carefully and choose wisely when seasoning homemade food start with herbs spices citrus and vinegar and then add salt you might be surprised at how much salt you add to food while cooking high sodium diet can lead to high blood pressure stroke heart disease heart failure choose minimally processed foods all food has been processed to some extent even fresh fruits and vegetables must be harvested cleaned and in some cases polished before they make it to your local market how do you know food has been minimally processed good rule of thumb is to choose packaged foods and healthy snacks with ingredients you can pronounce fruit and nut bar that contains ingredients like dates cherries almonds and walnuts in other words easily identifiable ingredients is good choice avoid heavily processed foods with laundry list of ingredients especially unrecognizable ones pick your fats wisely in years past dietary fat had bad rap the low fat craze led to fats being removed from packaged foods only to be replaced by sugar which as we discussed above is not good substitute today we know that not all fats are created equal and that good fat the polyunsaturated and monounsaturated varieties are essential for health industrial made fats including trans fats should be avoided trans fats are byproduct of hydrogenation which involves forcing hydrogen molecules into oil to turn it into solid at room temperature and prevent rancidity good for shelf life bad for your arteries on food labels you ll typically see trans fats as hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil these fats increase your bad ldl low density lipoprotein cholesterol which can clog arteries and lead to host of health problems what about saturated fats these are mostly solid at room temperature and are found in foods like red meat butter whole milk and palm oil americans generally consume more saturated fats than they should although whether saturated fats are bad for us is still hotly contested the latest report released by the world health organization has linked processed meats with an increased cancer risk your best bet is opting for products that contain expeller pressed or cold pressed vegetable oils and better yet monounsaturated oils from avocados nuts and nut butters olives and high oleic variety sunflower oil increase vegetable intake pile those veggies onto your plate most of us don get enough vegetables every day the usda recommends     cups of vegetables per day for women and   cups per day for men but go ahead and eat more we dare you it easier than you think dress your sandwich with lettuce and tomato whip up veggie fruit smoothie after workout tuck bag of baby carrots in your bag and up the amount of veggies in your stir fry there are myriad of ways to increase your daily intake of veggies cut back on the booze cook with wine sometimes even add it to the food c fields most of us by now have heard the reports that moderate alcohol consumption may help protect against cardiovascular disease this is because moderate levels of alcohol increase levels of high density lipoprotein hdl our good cholesterol the problem comes in defining what constitutes moderate drinking whether it one drink per day or three is contested even among alcohol researchers here are some good rules to follow stay within the recommended one drink per day for women or two for men avoid binge drinking sorry folks imbibing your weekly allotment of adult beverages on saturday night isn part of moderate drinking program just say no to fruity drinks loaded with sugar cut back on meat and dairy most americans eat far more meat and dairy than is recommended by the usda many of us don know what our daily protein needs are which is part of the problem the average woman needs just   grams of protein day while man needs around   grams day that less than two ounces six ounce steak contains as much protein as woman needs for an entire day but that same six ounce steak comes with increased risks from carcinogens and saturated fat unlike other sources of protein such as beans peas lentils nuts grains and even some leafy green vegetables we ve been told since we were little to drink our milk for strong bones but many might be surprised to learn that dairy may actually leach calcium from bones and three quarters of the world is lactose intolerant best to cut back on meat and dairy consumption and up alternative sources of protein like beans nuts and protein packed veggies and grains up your fruit intake it a common misconception that we should limit our fruit intake because fruit contains sugar in our first tip we explained the importance of the fructose to fiber ratio the fiber content in fruit helps the body absorb sugar more slowly so go ahead indulge in daily doses of delicious fruitiness and don forget that all natural snacks like fruit bars made from fruit juices and purees count toward your daily fruit intake drink more water water is essential for every single one of our bodily functions it also flushes toxins from the body plain water is the best option for staying hydrated but fruits and vegetables with high water content such as watermelon lettuce and tomatoes can also help you stay hydrated your water needs can vary dramatically depending on the season and your level of physical activity but at minimum strive

       " ' memories taken by alzheimer could possibly be retrieved paracetamol useless in treating osteoarthritis pain paracetamol is next to useless at alleviating arthritic pain the times reports comprehensive review of existing data suggests paracetamol should not be used in cases of osteoarthritis as there are far more effective treatments available osteoarthritis is now the leading cause of joint pain and stiffness in older people the review showed that paracetamol at any dose had very low chance of improving pain linked to osteoarthritis     chance despite being advised as the painkiller of first choice in current guidance in contrast the non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids class of painkillers such as diclofenac  mg per day and etoricoxib     or  mg per day were found more likely to improve pain between   and   likely and were the top ranked painkilling drugs potential drawback to nsaids is that long term use can trigger complications such as stomach ulcers and in rarer cases heart failure if person is thought to be at risk of stomach ulcers additional protective medication such as proton pump inhibitors may also be prescribed nice the uk health watchdog which issues guidance to doctors is in the process of updating its guidance on drug management of osteoarthritis therefore it is likely that this latest study will feed into the process if you have concerns speak to your doctor do not change prescribed medications without consulting your doctor first not doing so may damage your health lifestyle changes such as losing weight and regular exercise can also help relieve symptoms of osteoarthritis universities in switzerland and canada and was funded by the swiss national science foundation and arco foundation many of the researchers involved in the project reported that they were employed by or had received grants from pharmaceutical companies the study was published medical journal the lancet the uk media reports were generally accurate but largely ignored the good news about nsaids and instead focused on debating whether paracetamol should be used for arthritic pain this is reasonable line to take due to the large numbers of people who use paracetamol to relieve arthritis pain both in the uk and around the world was meta analysis of randomised control trials rcts looking at how effective different drugs were to help lower pain linked to osteoarthritis osteoarthritis is condition that causes the joints to become painful and stiff it is the most common type of arthritis in the uk there is no cure for osteoarthritis but it can be effectively managed the main treatments for osteoarthritis include lifestyle measures such as maintaining healthy weight and exercising regularly medication to relieve your pain including paracetamol and supportive therapies to help make everyday activities easier the analysis found   decent sized rcts with over   people comparing different nsaids or paracetamol with placebo to improve osteoarthritic pain how well the drugs improved joint movement was also assessed included nsaids that are available in the uk were ibuprofen celecoxib commonly called cox   inhibitor etoricoxib commonly called cox   inhibitor the analysis also included rofecoxib and lumiracoxib both of which have been withdrawn from the uk market due to safety concerns in total     people were included in the analysis average median follow up was   weeks with large range from one week to one year the researchers used statistical technique called network meta analysis this allows direct and indirect comparisons of drugs for example if one study compared paracetamol with placebo and second compared an nsaid with placebo in similar conditions this technique allows you to estimate the probability that paracetamol works better than the nsaid including these indirect comparisons is useful but not as accurate as trials directly comparing one drug with another sometimes called head to head trials this review included both direct and indirect comparisons the final output was rank of all the nsaids paracetamol and placebo and an estimate of their ability to achieve minimum clinically important difference in pain the minimum difference was defined at set point reduction     standard deviations within the overall spread of pain reductions for each trial etoricoxib  mg or  mg and diclofenac  mg per day the maximum dose were very likely to improve pain between   and   likely and were the top ranked nsaids the withdrawn drug rofecoxib was also similarly ranked the bottom of the ranking table was filled with different doses of paracetamol for example the highest ranked paracetamol dose  g per day was linked to only   chance of helping pain to useful level doses less than  g had only   chance of helping pain ranking second to last behind naproxen  mg concluded on the basis of the available data we see no role for single agent paracetamol for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis irrespective of dose they added we provide sound evidence that diclofenac  mg day is the most effective nsaid available at present in terms of improving both pain and function nevertheless in view of the safety profile of these drugs physicians need to consider our results together with all known safety information when selecting the preparation and dose for individual patients conclusion this swiss study reviewed drugs commonly used and recommended to help pain associated with osteoarthritis through indirect comparison it identified those likely to be most effective diclofenac   mg day and those that are pretty likely to be useless paracetamol any dose the study looked at large number of good sized rcts all with more than   people and covered useful range of nsaids the quality of the rcts was also assessed and was generally not highly biased although variable however the review included many indirect comparisons of the drugs which is less accurate and reliable than direct comparisons but without more direct comparisons available this is probably the best we have to go on for now the main implication from the study authors point of view was clear paracetamol has no place in the pain management of osteoarthritis on its own this finding jars with the uk current national guidance that advocates using paracetamol as first choice painkiller alongside other osteoarthritis management the fact paracetamol might not be useful in the pain management of osteoarthritis does appear to be recognised by nice the watchdog that issues guidance on medicines although the current guidance based on   recommendations advocates its use for example nice reports that it is in the process of updating the guidance and hints that paracetamol may be less effective than thought in   nice makes point of saying on its website that an evidence review on the effectiveness of paracetamol as part of consultation exercise showed reduced effectiveness of paracetamol in the management of osteoarthritis compared with what was previously thought the current guideline on pain management in osteoarthritis is due to be updated in september   in the meantime if you have concerns about taking paracetamol for pain linked to osteoarthritis consult your doctor before changing your medications it is also important not to overlook the benefits

       " 'i guess you could say we re going back to the future return to tomorrow was published in   towards the tail end of hubbard golden age pulp writer period but before his criminal cult leader period began in earnest it actually debuted four years earlier as to the stars two part story in the monthly astounding science fiction which is why the only wikipedia page for return to tomorrow refers to star trek episode and think this means that the book cover is lying to me when it claims this story is an ace book original novel never before published not even an asterisk explaining as complete story to cover their asses as you can see from that cover this here a vintage sci fi story we ve got classic rocket ships landed on their tail ends we ve got sleek weapons that can only be ray guns and we ve got useless fins on the helmets of the space suits which refer to with sarcastic quotation marks because the things don even have gloves at least put on some mittens dearie space is cold our story hook on the back cover is shanghaied into eternity our protagonist alan corday is doomed to be captured by captain jocelyn to crew spaceship since not even wealth and women were sufficient to fill his crew vacancies that because of the terrible price you pay for sailing between worlds which will be elaborated on later so we re due for mutiny swashbuckling pirates and the acrid fumes of war of annihilation as mr corday tries to get home also m tickled that women is listed as lure to entice sailors you there strapping young lad would you like to leave your old life behind and sign on for months of labor inside cold steel shell wrapped in the colder void of space possibly to never see your home world again no you might get laid ve reconsidered but what is this fearsome price that all star sailors must pay perhaps the prologue will elaborate space is deep man is small and time is his relentless enemy do we have to be so disparaging can we say that man is big but space is just bigger in an ancient and forgotten age the early  th century he first discovered the barricade before space travel first began he knew the barricade was there it was an equation without the equation the basic equation of mass and time man could not have progressed beyond barbaric fire er think we had at least made it to the medieval age maybe even the industrial era before busting out this particular physics equation but he did progress oh well objection withdrawn then mean if you are going to immediately contradict yourself and he used fission and his mechanicians did you mean machinations became mighty and his hopes large but the terms of his salvation were the terms of his imprisonment as well as mass approaches infinity time approaches zero ah see as man sits on the couch and eats microwave dinners he gains weight exponentially but his time runs out and he dies of heart failure the narrator credits this equation to lortentz and fitzgerald and especially theoretical philosopher named einstein with the power of this equation that man fellow was able to colonize the solar system yet at the same time it almost denied to him the stars and by almost mean didn and yet despite the difficulty derived by these great men and confirmed first by nuclear physicists and then by actual use there were still those who accepted and yet defied the law small cohort of ships and men who throughout the ages have kept the routes alive the outcasts and pariahs of extra atmosphere travel the cursed and shunned by man they course their lonely ways far bound but prisoners too shackled fast by time knowing well their waiting fate who would volunteer to become part of that thin group er the outcasts and pariahs those cursed and shunned by but amongst the societies of man there are always those who are outcasts from character or force of circumstance and there are adventurers who will not heed equations and so the stars were reached and partially explored despite the fact of those who made the runs this narrator is going to keep answering his own questions by repeating information he gave before asking them also my hunch is that supposed to be despite the fate of those who made the runs but let get down to the brass tacks whatever those are these outcasts take what called the long passage to places like alpha centauri which spaceship can reach in six weeks sometimes they re earnest adventurers sometimes they re criminals and fugitives trying to evade capture at any rate if they ever get back to their port of origin they ll find it irrevocably changed because while it a six week voyage for them many years will have passed planetside this can be bit inconvenient he who is gone for century cannot well return he knows too little his people are dead he has no place and he does not fit and what may have begun as an adventure for crew invariably ended in the same way another passage out while behind them further age accumulated while the crew stayed young the only fraternity was within the ship the only hope was that some day someone might discover another equation solution to the barricade as mass approaches the speed of light time approaches zero the outcasts of the long passage those that stayed alive never ceased to hope see this is story about time dilation and true to form the author is muddling it up as ve said before my career in hard science was cut short by some bad experiences in high school so m not the most qualified person to discuss this topic but as far as ve been able to piece together the idea goes like this the faster you re moving compared to another frame of reference the less time seems to pass for you by their standards on your spaceship zipping around at warp whatever you wouldn notice anything weird but if you went back to earth you find that your ship clocks marked less time on your voyage than what your departure and return times on earth would indicate thus flying around at high speeds is form of one way only forward time travel as for where mass enters his equation err think hubbard latched on to the notion of relativistic mass but don think this actually means you get bigger or anything as you approach lightspeed and the time approaches zero bit is also perplexing since it would imply that what as you move fast you get bigger and then stop moving at all it probably better to ignore this cruel equation altogether and just keep in mind that weeks aboard spaceship can equal years for your family back home except it sounds like this story is going to be about trying to find breakthrough new equation this could be problematic story based on solving misunderstanding of advanced physics ',\n",

       " 'march        am edt current clinical trials are evaluating stem cell therapies for conditions ranging from eye disease to aids discoveries in stem cell science over the past decade are finally starting to reach the clinic current clinical trials are evaluating stem cell therapies for conditions ranging from eye disease to aids these trials are going on in the united states europe canada japan and elsewhere but australia is lagging behind while we remain fairly competitive in fundamental research we are slow to translate our discoveries into new therapies this concern was expressed in the australian academy of science report released today called the stem cell revolution lessons and imperatives for australia it contains series of recommendations from young research leaders in the field on how australian science policy can help fast track stem cell research here researchers are often asked by patients or their relatives when stem cell treatments will be available for certain medical conditions ten years ago the answer would have been that there are no new treatments yet but we are working to develop them today we are forced to answer that clinical trials of cell therapies for particular conditions are going on but not in australia we have an obligation to ensure that australian patients their families carers and physicians are not left behind in the stem cell revolution stem cell therapy human embryonic stem cells which can become cells in any tissue of the body were first discovered in   today embryonic stem cell treatment trials are underway for macular degeneration common form of blindness spinal cord injury juvenile diabetes and heart failure embryonic stem cell therapies are being trialled for macular degeneration common form of blindness embryonic stem cell therapies are being trialled for macular degeneration common form of blindness then there are the induced pluripotent stem ips cells that japanese scientist shinya yamanaka discovered which won him the nobel prize in   ips cells are made from adult tissues and have many of the defining properties of embryonic stem cells they can be made from skin or blood cells of any person after yamanaka discovery japan cell therapy regulatory framework was modified to fast track products from these new stem cells into the clinic as consequence therapies using induced ips cells which enable close tissue matching of stem cell transplants to patients to prevent graft rejection are now in clinical trials there only ten years after their discovery more trials will begin very soon for instance years of research on midbrain dopaminergic neurons the cells lost in parkinson disease has paved the way for upcoming trials of stem cells replacing these lost neurons there are also large number of human trials in progress using mesenchymal stem cells which are extracted from bone marrow fat or other tissues capable of modulating the immune system and inflammatory response these stem cells have the potential ability to treat arthritis autoimmune disorders graft versus host disease in bone marrow transplant patients and number of other conditions neural stem cells derived from either foetal or adult brain tissue are also undergoing testing in humans for rare inherited disorders of the brain or more common conditions including spinal cord injury it unlikely these early stage trials will produce cures for any of these conditions indeed they might pose as many questions as they answer but it is essential and significant that these trials are moving forward because the lessons we learn from them will guide us towards the design of the next generation of cellular therapeutics gene therapy and drug discovery today genetic modification of stem cells with precision can provide cell therapies that can permanently correct serious genetic disorders human embryonic stem cells can become cells in tissue in any part of the body for years progress in gene therapy was almost totally blocked by safety concerns around the relatively crude technologies for introducing genetic alterations into patient cells but technological advances have enabled precise correction of genetic defects within cell this avoids off target modifications that can cause cancers and other serious toxicities new treatments using combined gene and cell therapy are undergoing trials now the california institute of regenerative medicinelists about ten new human studies including in aids blood diseases and cancer then there is third stream of stem cell research that although perhaps less visible to the general public has implications well beyond cell therapy this is the ability to derive pluripotent stem cells from patients with genetic predisposition to disease or to introduce disease mutations into stem cells via gene editing we can then use these disease specific stem cell lines to generate the cell types affected in particular disorder to study what goes wrong with them in the lab for instance we can study how gene that causes epilepsy affects the electrical properties of human nerve cells once we develop these cell culture models we can use them to screen candidate drugs to correct the deficits in the affected cells this technology will enable us to reduce dependence on animal models which don always replicate human diseases and will reduce the risk of testing drugs on living human subjects these advances have the potential to speed the discovery of new medicines to rapidly eliminate candidate drugs that might cause toxicity in the clinic and to save millions from the costs of drug development to ensure australian patients have timely access to new stem cell therapies for intractable diseases we must maintain our excellence in fundamental stem cell research but we also need to develop new and better mechanisms to support collaboration between academia the private sector and philanthropists with the aim of translating discoveries into cures

       " 'reposted from dr mercola http articles mercola com sites articles archive       salt intake heart failure aspx x_cid  _nonlead _salt intake heart failure_facebookdoc by dr mercola close to   million americans have heart failure while more than     cases are diagnosed each year if you have heart failure it means your heart isn pumping as well as it should be and as result your body is probably not getting enough oxygen in other words you have weak heart once simple activities like walking or carrying groceries may become difficult and you may also experience fatigue shortness of breath fluid build up and coughing   because heart failure is associated with fluid build up low salt diet is typically recommended excess sodium may cause your body to retain water and so the conventional thinking goes may worsen the fluid build up associated with heart failure this dietary dogma is touted as fact but in reality you may want to think twice about slashing your salt intake if you have heart failure as new research has linked it with an increased risk of death cutting down salt intake might worsen health of heart failure patients researchers from rush university medical center in chicago followed more than   heart failure patients for an average of three years both their health status and salt intake were analyzed   it turned out that those following low sodium diet were   percent more likely to die or require hospitalization for heart disease compared to those who didn restrict their salt intake   among those restricting their sodium intake   percent died or were hospitalized for heart problems during the study compared to   percent of those with no salt restrictions the researchers concluded in symptomatic patients with chronic hf heart failure sodium restriction may have detrimental impact on outcome   it possible that restricting salt could backfire by altering person fluid volumes lead researcher dr rami doukky told medical xpress   the idea is sodium restriction leads to contraction of the fluid volume in the body and that turns on certain hormones which try to retain fluids in the body and may potentially accelerate the heart failure process heart benefits of salt restriction increasingly questioned the heart benefits of restricting salt intake have been questioned for some time in   systematic review of data involving     people also found evidence was lacking to recommend salt restriction   among people with high blood pressure or normal blood pressure salt restriction was not significantly associated with overall mortality or cardiovascular mortality among those with congestive heart failure meanwhile salt restriction was associated with increased mortality risk an update to the review published in   also found there is insufficient power to confirm clinically important effects of dietary advice and salt substitution on cardiovascular mortality among people with high blood pressure or normal blood pressure   yet another meta analysis found that people with heart failure who limited their sodium intake had   percent higher risk of death than those who did not   some studies have shown modest benefit to salt restriction among some people with high blood pressure but the evidence does not extend to the rest of the population so what really going on for starters there a huge difference between natural salt and the processed salt added to processed foods and salt shakers in most homes and restaurants the former is essential for good health whereas the latter is best avoided altogether sally fallon morell president of the weston price foundation stated   study from   indicates that people need about one and one half teaspoons of salt per day anything less triggers cascade of hormones to recuperate sodium from the waste stream hormones that make people vulnerable to heart disease and kidney problems this is proven biochemistry too little salt may be dangerous the s food and drug administration fda and the food safety inspection service fsis recommend limiting your daily sodium intake to less than     milligrams mg they advise further reduction to     mg just over one half teaspoon for people who are age   and older african american or who have hypertension diabetes or chronic kidney disease this encompasses about half of the s population however there are very real risks from eating too little salt and population wide recommendations to restrict salt intake to very low levels could in fact increase rates of wide range of diseases for instance in one study low salt diet led to an increase in insulin resistance which is risk factor for type   diabetes and the change occurred in just seven days   research published in jama also found that consuming less than     mg of sodium per day may increase your risk of dying from heart disease   low sodium diet is even linked to increases in ldl cholesterol and triglycerides   and an increased risk of death for diabetics another population that often advised to restrict their sodium intake   there also hyponatremia in which your body has too little sodium causing fluid levels to rise and your cells to swell hyponatremia is most common in older adults and athletes whose sodium levels may become depleted by excessive sweating and drinking too much water this swelling can cause number of health problems from mild to severe at its worst hyponatremia can be life threatening leading to brain swelling coma and death but mild to moderate hyponatremia has more subtle effects that you or your health care provider may not even connect with sodium deficiency problem including nausea vomiting and changes in appetite headache confusion hallucinations loss of energy fatigue urinary incontinence nervousness restlessness and irritability and other mood changes muscle weakness spasms or cramps seizures unconsciousness coma your sodium potassium ratio another factor that can have significant impact on whether salt will harm or help your health is the ratio between the salt and potassium in your diet your body needs potassium to maintain proper ph levels in your body fluids and it also plays an integral role in regulating your blood pressure it possible that potassium deficiency may be more responsible for hypertension which is risk factor for heart disease than excess sodium imbalance in your sodium potassium ratio can lead to hypertension and the easiest way to achieve this imbalance is by consuming diet of processed foods which are notoriously low in potassium while high in sodium processed foods are also loaded with fructose which is clearly associated with increased hypertension risk as well as virtually all chronic diseases this may also explain why high sodium diets appear to affect some people but not others according to   federal study into sodium and potassium intake those at greatest risk of cardiovascular disease were those who got combination of too much sodium along with too little potassium   according to dr elena kuklina one of the lead authors of the study potassium may neutralize the heart damaging effects of salt tellingly those who ate lot of salt and very little potassium were more than twice as likely to die from heart attack as those who ate about equal amounts of both nutrients while potassium is found in many foods commonly consumed in the s including fruits vegetables dairy products salmon sardines and nuts only   percent of s adults get the recommended daily amount of     mg   the easiest way to achieve an imbalance in your sodium to potassium ratio is by consuming diet of processed foods which are notoriously low in potassium while high in processed salt according to the fda   percent of americans sodium intake comes from processed and restaurant foods when you reduce processed foods in your diet you ll automatically reduce your intake of processed salt as well how to improve your sodium potassium ratio if you eat lot of processed foods and not many vegetables there a good chance your sodium to potassium ratio is unbalanced if you re not sure try free app like my fitness pal which allows you to enter the foods you eat and then calculates the ratio automatically it generally recommended that you consume five times more potassium than sodium but most americans get two times more sodium than potassium if your ratio is out of balance ditch all processed foods which are very high in processed salt and low in potassium and other essential nutrients eat diet of whole unprocessed foods ideally organically and locally grown to ensure optimal nutrient content this type of diet will naturally provide much larger amounts of potassium in relation to sodium when using added salt use natural salt believe himalayan salt may be ideal as it contains lower sodium and higher potassium levels compared to other salts it can be difficult to get enough potassium from diet but the best way to do so is to increase the amount of vegetables you consume green vegetable juicing is an excellent way to ensure you re getting enough nutrients for optimal health including about   to   mg of potassium per cup some additional rich sources of potassium are lima beans   mg cup winter squash   mg cup cooked spinach   mg cup avocado   mg per medium other potassium rich fruits and vegetables include fruits papayas prunes cantaloupe and bananas but be careful of bananas as they are high in sugar and have half the potassium of an equivalent amount of green vegetables it is myth that you are getting loads of potassium from bananas the potassium is twice as high in green vegetables vegetables broccoli brussels sprouts avocados asparagus pumpkin swiss chard and beet greens top tips to prevent heart failure and other heart problems there are many strategies that can protect your heart no matter what your age please don wait until you experience heart attack symptoms or heart failure to take action because by then it may be too late do so now in order to prevent any long lasting damage eat unprocessed saturated animal fats and ignore the media as you will benefit from these fats many may also benefit from increasing the healthy fat in their diet to   to   percent of daily calories avoid sugars including processed fructose and grains if you are insulin and leptin resistant it doesn matter if they are conventional or organic as high sugar high grain diet promotes insulin and leptin resistance which is primary driver of heart disease minimize your intake of salt from processed foods and instead use natural himalayan salt to flavor your real food exercise regularly people who engage in at least   minutes of moderate exercise or   minutes of vigorous exercise week had
